family tree website for Fenwick McDonald McIntyre Rankin Schneider Pieper Suchting Lobegeiger and more

Work in Progress

The original template was from htmltemplates.net. <br>
The site uses only plain html and one css file (without javasript or any other scripting language). <br>
Browsing is via the top navigation bar on each page or some button type links where applicable. <br>
Extra info is provided in boxes with grayed backgrounds with a thin outline to hold tables, text or images. <br>
Image files have been kept as small as possible without losing legibility. <br>
Images can be clicked-on to open the full sized version. <br>
