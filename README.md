family tree website for Fenwick McDonald McIntyre Rankin Schneider Pieper Suchting Lobegeiger and more

Work in Progress

The original template was from htmltemplates.net.
The site uses only plain html and one css file (without javasript or any other scripting language). 
Browsing is via the top navigation bar on each page or some button type links where applicable.
Extra info is provided in boxes with grayed backgrounds with a thin outline to hold tables, text or images.
Image files have been kept as small as possible without losing legibility.
Images can be clicked-on to open the full sized version.
