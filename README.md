A family tree website for Fenwick, McDonald, McIntyre, Rankin, Schneider, Pieper, Suchting, Lobegeiger and more families.

This is a work in progress.

The static website employs only html, css and javascript. <br>
Browsing is via the top navigation bar on each page and/or some button type links where applicable. <br>
Extra info is provided in boxes with grayed backgrounds and a thin outline, holding tables, text or images. <br>
Image files have been kept as small as possible without losing clarity. <br>
Images can be clicked upon to open the full-sized version. <br>
The original css template was from htmltemplates.net but has been heavily modified. <br>
