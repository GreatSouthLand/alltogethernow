    <h5>What's in a name?</h5>
    The name Schneider could come from a number of different occupations. The word itself just means 'cutter' in English but the most common translation is 'tailor', from the occupation of the cloth cutter who made clothes. There was also a brush cutter who cleared highways and byways to make them passable. The work was accompanied by a Schroeder who shredded the cut off trees, branches and brush. Then there was a wood cutter (Holzschneider) or a board cutter (Brettschneider), who turned logs into something useful for building and furniture making. Another profession involved in cutting is that of the hair cutter (Haarschneider) an old name for a barber or barbier.
    <br><br>
    The curious thing about the name is that none of our ancestors or their family seemed to have had anything to do with cutting. They were masons, wrights, farmers, bakers, preachers and what have you but not cutters. Yet that could have something to do with the hundreds of occupations which have been lost as times changed, rendering them no longer viable or necessary and people moved onto other activities.

    <p>The Death of King Wilhelm I (1864)</p>
    </div>

    <h5>And The Times They Changed</h5>
    In May of 1864, Johann Heinrich Schneider was the first of our ancestors with the name Schneider to have migrated to Australia. He came from a place called Eberstadt near his birthplace of Ellhofen both of which were in the kingdom of Württemberg.
    <br><br>
    To understand some more of the lands of our forebears, a little history can be helpful. Since medieval times, Württemberg was an independent self-ruled member state of the Holy Roman Empire.
    <br><br>
    The empire was finally dissoved in 1806 which made way for Württemberg to be made into a kingdom.  In Johann's day, the country of Germany had not yet formed and the kingdom was still under the rule of Wilhelm I, the very last German king.
    <br>
    </div>
    <br>


    <div class="gto">
    <h5>From a Duke to a King</h5>
    Wilhelm I descended from a long line of Kings, Princes, Dukes and so forth. For instance,  King George II of Great Britain &amp; Ireland was one of his great-great-grandfathers. Another was the Prussian King Friedrich Wilhelm I on both his great-grandmother's and great-grandfather's sides.
    <br><br>
    Wilhelm's father was the 16th Duke of Württemberg, Friedrich II, commonly known as Fat Freddie (Dicker Friedrich). During his reign, Friedrich also managed to become a Kurfürst, one of seven or more high ranking Dukes within the the Holy Roman Empire who held the collective right to elect a King. That wasn't all, though. He also became the first king of Württemberg as Friedrich I.
    <br><br>
    This came about because he had struck a deal with Napolean Bonaparte to supply a massive auxillary force to France. In return Württemberg was raised to the status of a kingdom but at a cost. Over 15,000 Württembergers died in the battle against Russia alone.  It was no coincidence either that Frederick's daughter, Princess Catharina happened to be married to Jerome Bonaparte, Napolean's youngest brother.
    <br><br>
    For 48 years, from September 1819, Frederick's son King Wilhelm I ruled over the Kingdom of Württemberg. Upon his death in June 1864, the land was destined for major change. Before he died though he had made a lot of changes of his own.

    In 1949 the lands which were once Württemberg and Baden both became part of the Republic of Germany.
    Since 1952, Württemberg has been part of the German modern state of Baden-Württemberg.

    <h5>A Family of Master Stone Masons</h5>
    The profession of the Stone Mason is one of the oldest occupations in existence, dating back at least 40,000 years. It also has a long history in the Schneider family. Every generation that can be traced to have lived in Germany had the head of the family and at least one son working as stone masons or masons, sometimes as both, and often as masters of their art. The earliest of the stone mason Schneiders were settled in Hertmannsweiler in the district of Winnenden.
    <br><br>
    Stone masons would likely have been in big demand in and around Hertmannsweiler. The nearby settlement of Winnental held the royal seat, Winnental Castle (Schloss Winnental) belonging to the ruler of the land. Each Duke who took over the title naturally enough had to expand his domain and that involved new designs and new extensions to be built, out of stone.
    <br><br>
    As well as that, the Duke had a summer residence, Rosenstein Castle (Schloss Rosenstein), also requiring lots of attention to its stonework. There were also churches, government buildings and other edifices to keep both architects and stone masons busy.

    According to the official reports of the Administrative Offices of Württemberg (1861), all the residents of the districts of Winnenden and Weinsberg, including Ellhofen and Eberstadt, occupied themselves with small scale farming. This was the case even for qualified tradesmen and professionals.
    <br><br>
    Every household supplied enough food for family use and none was sold. This meant that the residents were all maintaining a self-sufficient lifestyle, ensuring they had plenty of food and produce from their own fields including grains, fruits, wine and dairy.

    So the Schneiders, having come from there,  would have had plenty of experience and confidence to take up farming upon arrival in Australia, which of course they all did.
    <br><br>
    As was done at the time for occupations with a guild, the generations of our Schneiders formed a family of trained and qualified specialists. Masons and stone masons worked side by side, brother with brother, father with son, passing on both experience and responsibility.

    <h5>How to get to Australia from Germany</h5>
    1860 saw the creation of the new Colony of Queensland, separating itself from the already existing New South Wales. Around the end of that year, a group of 206 German migrants living in Drayton and Toowoomba petitioned the newly formed Government to encourage more German migration to Queensland. In response to this Johann Christian Heussler was appointed to go to Germany to act as immigration agent for the Queensland Government.
    <br><br>
    He spent about two years there and eventually two ships, the "Grasbrook" carrying 123 new German settlers and the "Caesar Godeffroy" with 295 more new colonists were sent out. They both arrived in the new land on the same day, November 27, 1861. A few years later, Heussler became a member of the Queensland Legislative Council and his home 'Fernberg' eventually became and still is the residence of the Govenor of Queensland.

    Back in 1848 though, a German from Frankfurt by the name of Wilhelm Kirchner had already paved the way by writing a book in the German language encouraging his kinsfolk to migrate to the colony of New South Wales.  Kirchner had migrated himself in 1839 and returned to Germany in 1848 to espouse the wonders of his newly adopted land. He was so successful with his campaign that the Prussian Government appointed him Consul for the Colony.
    <br><br>
    The New South Wales Government, also being thrilled by his exploits, enabled him to offer cheap tickets for prospective migrants. One of his big selling points was that the first Governor of New South Wales, Arthur Phillip, was the son of a German who had migrated from Frankfurt to England. That was accompanied by glowing accounts of more food than there were people to eat it, more jobs than there were workers to fill them, a wonderful climate and land just waiting to be owned.

    <h5>The Schneiders Go to Australia</h5>
    Whatever the real reason the Schneiders had for migrating to Australia, there had been quite a few tragedies preceeding it. In 1859, Johann Georg's second eldest son, Friedrich Karl died from an 'unlucky work accident' at only 21. By then three of his daughters had also died. Johann Georg's eldest brother, Georg Karl, had been lost to Tuberculosis when only 19. Another brother, Johann Friedrich who not only lost two wives and most of his infant children, also died in 1863. For a family business which relied so much on fathers, sons and  brothers working together as highly trained and qualified specialists, as well as being close family, to lose so many members must have been shattering to say the least.
    <br><br>
    So, Johann Heinrich, later known as Henry, along with his young family were the first of our Schneiders to migrate to Australia. They arrived in Moreton Bay on board the 'La Rochelle' in September 1864. Earlier that year, in January, the Lobegeier family migrated on board the 'Susannah Godeffroy'. The mother of that family, Wilhelmina, would later become Henry's second wife. In 1865 Henry's parents Johann Georg and Heinricke Margarethe with the rest of their children also migrated to Australia.

    <h5>What the Schneiders Did Next</h5>
    Upon landing in the new colony on September 5th 1864, Henry and Rosine applied for their own land. Five months after they had first set foot on Australian soil on the 18th February 1865, their application for Land Order 488 in both their names was accepted. That was rather timely because six months later Johann's father, mother, two brothers and three sisters all arrived on August 17th of that year.

    The four Schneider men, Johann Georg and his three sons, Johann Heinrich, Gottfried Friedrich and Johann Georg jun., went to Toowoomba where they prepared stone for the Victoria Tunnel at Grandchester on the new railway line being built between Ipswich and Toowoomba. That was followed by a contract to cut billets to fuel the railway engines already running to Grandchester. They also contributed to the masonry work on Parliament House being built in Brisbane.
    <br><br>
    By 1869 Johann Heinrich and Johann Georg had taken up adjoining land at Franklyn Vale with each having about 122 acres. By 1871 they were both listed, along with Fred, as having homesteads at Mt. Walker and Franklyn Vale, more recently known as Rosevale.
    <br><br>
    Johann Heinrich's father George had his selection of 40 acres of agricultural land and 80 acres of first class pastoral land in the Parish of Franklin accepted in 1873. At the same time Fred went for 40 acres nearby at Forbes. In 1877 Johann Heinrich took on another 200 acres in the Fassifern district at Kulgun. These are only a few examples of the land purchases but enough to show that the Schneiders were settling in to a place already notorious for its brigalow scrub.
    <br><br>

    underground suckers when the bushy outcrops are cut off. Clearing the land of it and establishing farms was intensely back breaking arduous work. The land they worked was nothing short of a wilderness, but as Fred said later in a news article about his life, 'they slaved and saved'. The womenfolk did too. While the men were off earning their living with railway construction, George's wife and daughters went out picking cotton at Booval near Ipswich.

    Mrs Enid Bell wrote of her 1875 journey into the Fassifern:
    <div style="margin:20px;">
    The train in those days only went as far as Peak Crossing.  From there was a 32 mile drive by four in hand to Coochin with a change at Milbong.  There was no township at Boonah then.  Thick tropical scrub green for miles between Harrisville and Boonah where the train now runs.

    and T. R. Paton in his Soils Survey described the historical development of land use in the scrub country:
    <div style="margin:20px;">
    The growing demand by the increasing population for locally produced food crops, together with the 1868 Conditional Purchase Act, led to farming settlement of parts of the area.  Since pastoral interests held the more desirable land, the only areas available to the immigrant farmers, mainly German, were the softwood and brigalow scrubs.  Thus, between 1870 and 1890 the whole of the Fassifern scrub around Boonah was cleared and occupied.  The first crops after clearing were maize and lucerne.  By 1900 most of the scrub farms had turned to dairying as the main source of income.  This change was hastened by the opening of the railways (Harrisville 1882, Boonah 1887, and Beaudesert 1888).

    <h5>The Fassifern's Early Days</h5>

    The earliest Europeans to explore the region later known as the Fassifern were Scots. The first attempt was made in 1827 by the notoriously detested Commandant of the Moreton Bay Penal Settlement, Captain Patrick Logan who hailed from Berwickshire in Scotland. At the very same time, Allan Cunningham, a Scot from Renfrewshire made his way up from the Upper Hunter Valley guided by the Perthshire Scot Peter McIntyre but the party was eventually forced back by the terrain. In 1828 Cunningham made another attempt, this time setting out from Moreton Bay, accompanied by Logan and yet another Scot, the Colonial Botanist Charles Fraser from Blair Atholl in Perthshire. Of course, Cunningham's main interest was his obsession over finding a gap in the Great Dividing Range that would allow the Darling Downs to be connected to Brisbane, for which he was successful on July 24.

    <br><br>
    The first settlers of the Fassifern Valley were John Cameron from Stirling in Scotland and Robert Coulson who had married Cameron's sister. Cameron's father was a soldier and an early settler of the Upper Hunter Valley having been granted 1280 acres of land near Scone and Peter McIntyre's property. Cameron, not wanting to be a soldier like his father turned his hand to sheep grazing. After first moving to New England and then to the Darling Downs, he finally took out the first lease on the 'Fassifern Run'. Coulson soon followed suit with the neighbouring 'Mooggerah Run'. Altogether the husbands of four of Cameron's sisters took up large runs in the Fassifern: Robert Coulson, Moogerah, William Turner, Tarome, Macquarie McDonald, Dugandan and John Rankin, Maroon.
    <br><br>
    The name Fassifern is taken to be derived from the Scottish highland hamlet of Fassiefern on the north shore of Loch Eil and about six miles west of Fort William. The area eventually came under the authority of Clan Cameron. There are many other place names in the Fassifern Valley of Scottish origin but eventually the German influence made itself known.

    <h5>Place Name Changes in the Scrub Country</h5>
    The changes that occurred to place names give an indication that the scrub country was being transformed into settlements and towns:
    <div style="margin:20px;">
    Fassifern Scrub -> Engelsburg -> Kalbar<br>
    The Scrub -> Cornhill -> Lowood<br>
    First Plain -> Sally Owens' Plains -> Rosewood Scrub -> Frederick -> Marburg -> Townshend -> Marburg<br>
    One Eye Waterhole -> Blantyre -> Milbong<br>
    Teviotville -> Coulson<br>
    Dugandan Scrub -> Blumbergville -> Boonah<br>
    Walloon Scrub -> Kirchheim -> Haigslea

    It's not too much of a coincidence that the Schneiders in Germany had a thing about building walls. In the old days, walls were a necessary part of defence for city, town, castle and house. In Australia, those defences were down. It was nigh on impossible to protect property and farms  from marauders. And that's exactly where Henry (Johann Heinrich) senior got himself into trouble. Big trouble. Around two o'clock in the morning of January 24, 1875, one Michael Portley with accomplices attempted to steal Henry's watermelons. Henry saw this as the last straw, having been under attack many times before. He gave warning he would shoot and upon no response, fired what he thought was a warning shot from across the field, in the dead of the night. Unfortunately, he hit the miscreant. Also unfortunately, he was found guilty in August the same year of unlawfully injuring and sentenced to one month hard labour at the Brisbane prison.
    <br><br>
    Of course in America at the same time watermelon theft was regarded as a crime against the national order and was heavily sentenced. In fact it was such a problem is was number one on the most frequently occurring crimes. And the state did something about it to protect both the farmers and their produce.

    <b>The Circle of Summertime</b><br>

    The Fassifern way of life and living can be nicely summarised <br>
    by the text to 'Vivaldi's Song' by Michael Franks:<br><br>

    <i>We weather the wind and rain <br>
    We grow the farm<br>
    We're safe from harm <br>
    Inside this circle of summertime</i>

<h2 class="subtitle">About <span>Us</span></h2>
<strong>We are the descendants</strong> of Anglo-Scottish-Prusso-Germanic
Australian migrants who settled in the newly formed colonies of New South Wales and Queensland
in the nineteenth century. The idea behind these pages is to present
the stories and characters of those early settlers along with information about their origins, descendants, families, whereabouts and activities.
<br><br>
There are often themes running through their struggles and
achievements telling a tale of resourcefulness and hardships in an alien world.
The paradox of Australia as an ancient and raw continent and as a 'New World' portrays
a collision of ideals and realities yet still shows a continuity in how those people dealt with everyday life.
