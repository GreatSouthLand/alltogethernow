    Many of our ancestors who had migrated from Germany naturally enough ended up in the same places as many other migrants, oftentimes marrying them. This page covers those related individuals and families who risked life and limb to find a new start in a new world. The migration of these people was the responsibilty of an agent who somehow convinced them to leave their homes and go to Australia and most, if not all, of them were brought out by <b>&raquo; <a href="schneider.html#heussler">J.

    <h2><b>1863 Michael and Magdalena Pfeffer</b></h2>
    <br>
    Joseph Michael Pfeffer and his wife Magdalena Elisabetha Kr채mer, along with six of their childen left their home in Neckasulm to board the Susannah Godeffroy, leaving Hamburg on the 19th of September, 1863 and reaching Moreton Bay on the 18th of January, the next year. One of their sons, Peter Joseph Pfeffer who was already 31 and married, when the rest of his family left, stayed behind. Sadly he died in Neckarsulm only five years later. 
    <br><br>
    Another son, Victor Francis Pfeffer was a very close friend to our 2x great-grandfather, Johann Heinrich Schneider. Victor married Friederike Schulz, the sister of our great-grandmother Ernestine Schulz whose granddaughter, Adelaide Pieper, married Victor Pfeffer's son William. There are lots of other inter-marryings too.
    <br><br>
    In 1864, the Susanne Godeffroy was reported to be a new ship classed as A1, weighing 914 tons of British measurement. The ship was built in L체beck for Goddefroy & Co. and this was its first voyage. The time from Lizard Point to first sighting was reckoned to be a run of 98 days.

    <p>Greetings from Neckarsulm</p>
    </div>

    The trip was a rough one, starting immediately with severe weather which detained the ship 15 days in the North Sea. That was followed by contrary winds between the Britsish Coast and Madeira. The trade winds carried her to the Cape of Good Hope but from there to the island of Tristan d'Acunha again there was heavy weather which sprung the main mast, foremast, foretopmast and fore yard. Nonetheless, from there, Tasmania was made in 30 days and Cape Moreton in another ten.
    <br><br>
    Dr. Hobbs, the health officer, visited the ship on the evening of Tuesday the 19th and found the 369 German immigrants, many of whom were skilled workmen, in good health. This was the first journey for the newly built Susanne Godeffroy and the ship made the run in 98 days.
    <br><br>
    Incidentally, also on board this ship was the Lobegeiger family, namely Wilhelmine Lobegeiger, nee Topp who, after the early death of her husband, eventually married our 2x great-grandfather, Johann Heinrich Schneider, mentioned earlier.

    <h2><b>1865 Johann and Dorothea Dickfoss</b></h2>
    <br>
    Johann Christian Friedrich Dickfoss and his second wife Dorothea, nee Runge, left their home in Strehlow in the Uckermark of Prussia on the 13th of October, 1865 departing from Hamburg on board the Cesar Godeffroy, a ship built in Hamburg in 1865. 
    <br><br>
    Strehlow is a village that lies a couple of kilometers north east of the Oberuckersee (Upper-Ucker-Lake) in the Uckermark. Their particular place of abode was most likely the  Gutshof (Estate) belonging to the von Arnim family, originally known as a Ritterhof (Knight's Estate).

    <br><br>
    Nowadays Strehlow belongs to Potzlow in the district of the Oberuckersee which in turn is part of the Uckermark. The village was first written down in 1317 as Strele, and was later known as Stelow. The name is derived from a Slavic word meaning 'arrow' noting its location on the M체hlgraben which flows into the Ucker River.
    <br><br>
    The only child from Johann's first marriage to Johanne Friederike Riek, was named Johann Friedrich August Dickfoss, known later as simply August Dickfos, dropping one 's' on the end as was the fashion in Australia. He married Heinricke Sophie Schneider, the daughter of Johann Georg Schneider, in 1869. The eldest son of Johann and Dorothea, Johann Carl Dickfos, married Christine Schneider, another child of Johann Georg Schneider, in 1871. The second youngest child of Johann and Dorothea, Johanna Caroline Wilhelmine Dickfos (Caroline), married another child of Johann Georg Schneider, Gottfried Friedrich Schneider (Fred), also in 1871.

    <br>
    <h5>Falkenwalde in the Uckermark of Preussen</h5>
    The Henselin family came from a place called Falkenwalde, which not only boasts remnants from the stone age and Slavic settlement from the early middle ages but more recently, in 1357, it was already mentioned as Valkenworde in the historically important medieval record known as the Landbuch der Mark Brandenburg. From 1993 to 2001 it was an independent community within the Uckermark but nowadays is part of Uckerfelde.

Stegelitz is a medieval village first mentioned in 1269 but decimated by the Thirty Year War and newly resettled in the early eighteenth century. Whatever the reason, in 1864, Gottlieb Lobegeiger and his family migrated from Stegelitz to Australia.

    As the ship's records show, the 26 year old Friedrich Suchting, an agriculturalist (Landmann) from Ahrensb철k in Holstein, boarded the Beausite to head off to Australia. The 932 ton Beausite departed Hamburg 23 October 1864 and arrived in Moreton Bay on 6 February 1865 under the charge of Captain Bruhm with C. Heussler and Co. as the agents.

    The trip from coast to coast was made in 104 days and except for some contrary winds off the Canary Islands had a smooth passage through the Atlantic and all the way to Tasmania. Cape Moreton was reached after another 13 days. Of the 300 immigrants on board, one half were single men and a very small proportion were single women. On the 8th February, the families and single females were conveyed to shore by a steamer, the Diamond. Due to the violence of the wind the steamer was required to return the next day to fetch the single men.
    <br><br>
    Those on board the Beausite shared their trip with a mixed cargo. This included 220 cases, 22 casks of wines, 60 cases geneva, 20 casks cognac, 3 cases pianos, 1 case books, 1 case cooper's utensils, 370 barrels cement, 533 packages, 5 cases of seltzer-water, 50 cases candles, 10 bales hay, 10 cases furniture, 10 rams and 40,000 fire bricks.

    By the time Georg and Heinricke migrated with five of their children to the new Colony of Queenland, their eldest son Johann Heinrich had already been there with his wife and child since the year before. Apparently Johann Heinrich had sent back such encouraging reports about the prospect of a new life in the new land that the idea of going there too was irresistible.

    So Georg, following in the footsteps of his son, packed up his family and made the 700 km trip to Hamburg from their home in Eberstadt in the district of Weinsberg. There they met up with their ship, the Sophie, which would take them to Australia. The Sophie departed from Hamburg under the command of Captain Wendt, on April 23, 1865 and arrived in Moreton Bay four months later, anchoring on August 17th. The 29 passengers who disembarked first needed a clean bill of health from the medical officer for which they had to wait until the 20th. On the 21st, the ship continued on with the rest of its 164 passengers and cargo to Maryborough.

    Ernestine Wilhelmine Schulz and her sisters Friederike, and Wilhelmine Christina hailed from Menkin in Pommerania, part of Prussia.

Wilhelmine's husband August Friedrich Wilhelm Zimmermann and their baby daughter Ernistine accompanied the three sisters. After a passage of 96 days, having already sailed past Cape Moreton, the ship first anchored in Hervey's Bay and transferred the majority of the immigrants on board to Maryborough. The Maryborough Chronicle reported that "the passengers landed here are, in appearance, as fine a body of men and women as ever immigrated".

    <h5>Hurrah! The Brides Have Arrived</h5>
    Upon approaching Maryborough, the steamer conveying the Herschel's passengers up the river created quite a bit of excitement. As it neared the crowds of awaiting relatives, friends, and migrant German men looking for wives, "the well known strains of 'Rhine Watch' resounding from several hundred lungs, fell on the ear. Thronging the deck in their quaint foreign-looking costumes, they sung as people only sing who have drunk month-long draughts of sea air, and whose hearts are light with the prospect of release from month-long confinement in a floating prison" (Maryborough Chronicle Tue 12 March 1872). The ship then proceeded further back down the coast with those passengers destined for Brisbane. This is where Ernestine and Friederike first set foot on Australian soil.

    <h5>A New Life in a New Land</h5>
    A few weeks after arriving, at the beginning of June, Ernestine's sister Friederike married Francis Victor Pfeffer who was a close friend and next door neighbour to Henry Schneider, our g-g-grandgather.  In October that same year, Ernestine who had just turned 19 a few months earlier, married a widower by the name of Johann Friedrich Wilhelm Pieper. Johann, the year before, had just lost his first wife Louise with whom he had migrated to Australia nine years earlier. So Ernestine not only gained a husband but also his seven children. She added five more to that number over the next ten or so years.
    One of those children, named Rudolph Pieper, was our great-grandfather.

<h2 class="subtitle">About <span>Us</span></h2>
<strong>We are the descendants</strong> of Anglo-Scottish-Prusso-Germanic
Australian migrants who settled in the newly formed colonies of New South Wales and Queensland
in the nineteenth century. The idea behind these pages is to present
the stories and characters of those early settlers along with information about their origins, descendants, families, whereabouts and activities.
<br><br>
There are often themes running through their struggles and
achievements telling a tale of resourcefulness and hardships in an alien world.
The paradox of Australia as an ancient and raw continent and as a 'New World' portrays
a collision of ideals and realities yet still shows a continuity in how those people dealt with everyday life.
