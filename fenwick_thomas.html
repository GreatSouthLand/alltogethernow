    <h5>Thomas Fenwick (1823-1896) <br>an argumentative man</h5>

    Where did Granddad Fred Fenwick’s red hair come from?

    <div class="rbox" style="width:18%; margin:0px 0px 16px 16px;">

    <p>Thomas Fenwick</p>
    </div>

    Quite possibly from his grandfather, Thomas Fenwick (1823-1896). Thomas was 47 when photographed with fellow aldermen outside the Shellharbour Council Chambers in 1870. His hair is lighter than all but one of his colleagues and only appears to be grey in parts of his beard, so it’s likely he had red hair. What we can glean about his personality from the many local newspaper accounts that mention him suggests that he matched the stereotype as well.

    <br><br>
    While the pioneers on Grandma Fenwick’s line — see <a href="mcdonald_australia.html"><b>Alexander McDonald (1815-1888)</b></a> and <a href="mcintyre_australia.html"><b>Duncan McIntyre (1830-1916)</b> </a> —  were establishing themselves in the Northern Rivers region of New South Wales, Granddad Fenwick’s forebears were further south, making waves in Shellharbour.
    <br><br>

    </div>

    Thomas was born in Preston, Yorkshire. His father’s name was John and his mother’s was Anne. In his hometown, he became a farmer and blacksmith and married Harriet Downes (1818-1894), a house servant from the nearby village of Sculcoates (who was the daughter of Robert and Anna Downes).

    <br><br>
    The newlyweds decided to emigrate to NSW on an assisted passage. They departed from London at the beginning of March 1844 on the Royal Saxon and arrived in Sydney in late June. He was about 21 and his bride some four years older. Ship records tell us that they could both read and write and were in good health.
    <br><br>
    Under the conditions of their passage, Thomas was required to work for 12 months as a blacksmith for Captain Addison at his Lake House estate in Shellharbour, south of Wollongong. (Captain Addison was the husband one of D’arcy Wentworth’s daughters—see below). Later, Thomas seems to have been promoted to manager. In all, he worked at the estate for nine years until the death of his employer.

    <h5>Shellharbour Village</h5>

    From the Shellharbour Museum website:
    <br><br>
    Shellharbour Village was part of a grant of over 13,000 acres to D’Arcy Wentworth, named Peterborough. The grant included all the land from the Minnamurra River in the south to Lake Illawarra in the north. Five of Wentworth’s children, Martha, Sophia, MaryAnn, Catherine, and Robert inherited the estate in 1827. Captains Towns, Addison and Darley married three of Wentworth’s daughters, and the main streets in Peterborough (now Shellharbour Village) are named after them.

    <br><br>

    In 1843, Caroline Chisholm brought 23 families to settle at Peterborough on clearing leases. Captain Robert Towns allowed settlers to live on his part of the estate, rent-free for six to seven years, on the condition they clear the land of all trees and scrub. Each family was given a lease to clear the land, and set up a self-sufficient farm. The families were dropped off at the beach in the afternoon and spent the night under the roots of a large fig tree near the harbour. The next morning, they were picked up by bullock and dray, and transported to the site of their farm.
    <br><br>
    On 22 September 1851, the private town of Peterborough was laid out and registered. It was predicted that the town would become an important shipping port on the coast. In 1856, the Illawarra Mercury reported that Shellharbour was beginning to assume the appearance of a ‘hamlet or little town’. Eleven families lived in eleven houses and farmers came and went with drays, horseback or on foot, carrying the produce of the Peterborough Estate, Macquarie River and Stoney Creek to be shipped to Sydney. By 1857, many of the families had secured or leased homes and properties. They turned mainly to dairying.

    <h5>Wollongong, Stoney Range and the Shellharbour Council</h5>

    </div>

    After a short stint in Wollongong, Thomas selected land at Stoney Range in the Shellharbour area and become a farmer in his own right. However, farming probably wasn’t front and centre in his life.
    <br><br>
    For 22 years, he was a member of the Shellharbour Borough Council and was elected mayor on three occasions. He played an active role in organising the construction of Shellharbour’s breakwater and jetty and was also appointed a magistrate of the territory.
    <br><br>

    <div class="rbox" style="width:25%; margin:0px 0px 16px 16px;">
    <a href="img/thomas/shellharbour_chambers.jpg">
    <img src="img/thomas/shellharbour_chambers.jpg" alt="">
    </a>
    <p>The Shellharbour Council Chambers, built from local basalt rubble, served the Council from 1865 to the late 1890s.</p>
    </div>

    In a Council meeting report, the Illawarra Mercury of 18th February 1870 stated that, “Alderman Killalea remarked that he and Alderman Fenwick were two of the oldest residents of Shellharbour”. This rings true, because while free settlement began in the area in 1817, the township itself was not laid out until 1851.
    <br><br>
    Thomas was also an active shareholder of the Shellharbour Steam Navigation Company, which local farmers formed in 1866 to ensure a shipping service to Sydney for their produce. The company’s first vessel was a schooner called Dairy Maid. The venture was so successful that profits paid for the vessel within five years. Later, the company invested in a steamer that bore the same name as its predecessor.

    The Illawarra Mercury reported that the £3766 vessel arrived on 8 April 1876 to much fanfare, with a dinner held for 500 people “under a large awning erected on the beach, near the well-known fig trees … The jetty had a crowd of promenaders and really the scene reminded one of the gay appearance of an English watering place".
    <br><br>


    <h5>The Community Man</h5>

    But Thomas didn’t limit himself to local politics and business interests. He was also a keen participant in community life generally, sometimes performing as a minstrel and humourist.
    <br><br>

    <b>From the Kiama Independent and Shoalhaven Advertiser of Tues 26 Nov 1889:</b>
    <br><br>
    A CONCERT in aid of funds for the local cricket club was held in the Temperance Hall Shellharbour on Tuesday evening 19th instant and was a decided success. For some time past Mr. A. Dettmer and others have been working with a will and their efforts have been crowned with success. The first item was a pianoforte duet by the Misses Hoy and Lindsey which were rendered in a pleasing manner.
    <br><br>
    The chairs were then occupied for the remainder of the first part of the performance, minstrelsy being the attraction. Mr. J. Inskip acted as "Johnson," and Messrs. Fenwick and Lynch as corner men. There were also on the chairs Messrs Carmody, Thomas, Holdern and Dettmer. Mr. C. Irish presided at the piano. Songs, choruses, and gags were given and well received, the whole winding up with the Ghost scene.
    <br><br>
    After a slight intermission Mr. Wood stepped forward as chairman of the concert and made a few remarks about its object, and also about the local cricket club. Misses Hoy and Lindsay again favoured the audience with another of their beautiful selections. Mr. G. Russel then gave a song, “Troubles await you my Boy,” and was in fine voice, receiving an encore.
    <br><br>
    Mr. H. Thomas’ song, with banjo accompaniment was the song of the evening. “His Lordship winked at the Counsel.” In this song Mr. Thomas’ fine voice mingled sweetly with the banjo and the result was a most vociferous encore, which was duly acknowledged. Mr. Carmody’s song and dance was much appreciated and he received an encore. Mr. Inskip sang in good style “McSorley’s Twins” and in response to an encore gave the last verse. Mr. E. Carmody next sang and did well. “Dear little Shamrock,” by Mr. Dettmer was pleasingly received.
    <br><br>
    Mr. Fenwick was very amusing in his Stump Speech. Mr. Holdern brought down the house with his song “Kissing” and was encored. Mr. Russell sang in his usual good style "The Fisherman and His Child.” Mr. Thomas again came in for much applause and an encore with “Papa’s Baby Boy.” Messrs. Fenwick and Inskip followed with a comic speech and this concluded the second part of the programme. Farce-The Star Restaurant - by Messrs. Fenwick, Dettmer, Lynch, Gallon, Inskip, Lewis, and others wound up the programme and was well performed, bringing a good evening’s entertainment to a close. About £17 10s was taken at the door. Dancing was then indulged in for some time.

    <h5>Weeds in the Courts</h5>

    Despite his obvious community-mindedness, Thomas was not above a bit of stirring. In 1872, he appeared in the Kiama Police Court charged with allowing weeds to grow on a piece of land he co-leased with a Mr. Baxter. In the following year, he faced the same court on the same charge. Each time, he represented himself and argued vociferously that the charges were out of order because of technicalities concerning the council inspector’s appointment along with the fact that he was no longer responsible for the land in question. All to no avail ultimately.
    <br><br>
    In 1884, he was found guilty of slandering an old woman in the street. Again, he represented himself unsuccessfully and ended up with a fine of £30 plus costs.
    <br><br>


    <h5>Vigorous Speech</h5>

    When an Illawarra Mercury report described his 1887 speech in favour of harbour improvements as “argumentative”, it seemed to encapsulate his character. Perhaps Thomas was a frustrated lawyer, in which case he must have felt in his element when he became a magistrate in his later years.
    <br><br>
    <b>Right: </b>
    Thomas Fenwick’s speech was described as “vigorous and argumentative”.
    <br><br>
    </div>


    <h5>Harriet</h5>

	Harriet died in 1894, aged 76, becoming the subject of a lengthy article run by two newspapers. Thomas lived less than two years longer, only reaching 73. They were both buried in the Albion Park Anglican Cemetery.
	<br><br>
	<br>
	<b>The Kiama Independent and Shoalhaven Advertiser of Thurs 25 Oct 1894
	<br>
	also Illawarra Mercury of Tues 23 October</b>
	<br><br>
	THE LATE MRS. THOMAS FENWICK<br>
	There passed away from this life, at Shellharbour on Monday. the 8th instant (says the " Illawarra Mercury "), one who had been a worthy resident of Illawarra for upwards of fifty years. We allude to Mrs. Fenwick wife of Mr Thomas Fenwick, J.P., of Stony Range Farm. As a wife, a mother, a neighbour, a member of the community in which she resided, the deceased was trustful and true, bearing to the grave, as she did in the full sense of the term, The white rose of a blameless life.
	<br><br>
	To her husband, who now deplores her death, though not as those without hope in regard to even a
	happier reunion in a better world, she was, as it were, a second part of himself, having travelled through life together, as they did, for more than 62 years with unruffled happiness in their conjugal relationship. And to her family of three sons and one daughter she was in a sentence, all that a loving mother could be.
	<br><br>
	She reached a good age, having passed her 76th year by a few months when summoned hence. Until
	about twelve years ago she enjoyed robust health, but since then weakness of the heart troubled her to a noticeable extent. Six weeks prior to her death she became ill with the then prevailing influences, and suffered rather severely but gradually recovered. An attack of bronchitis supervened, however, and prostrated her very much in her already weak state. She became better of that also in due course, but, unexpectedly even to her medical attendant, her heart suddenly gave way, and all was over in less time than it takes to state the said fact. So sudden and unlooked for was the closing scene on a Monday forenoon- that her husband only was beside her when the “vital spark” took its flight to Him who gave it.
	<br><br>
	The funeral took place on the following day, the remains being interred in the Church of England burial ground, Albion Park. A large number paid their respects to the memory of the deceased by following all that was mortal of her to the last resting place, where the Rev. J. Stack, of Dapto, conducted the funeral service.
	<br><br>
	Mr. Thomas Fenwick and his wife, both of whom were then strong and vigorous, arrived in Sydney in
	1844. They left Detport, London, on the 1st of March of that year in the immigrant ship Royal Saxon,
	reaching Port Jackson on the 20th of June following. It will thus be noticed that the deceased had been a little over 50 years and three months in this colony at the time of her death.
	<br><br>
	Immediately after arrival at Sydney, Mr. Fenwick and his wife went to Shellharbour under engagement to the late Captain Addison, and for nine 	years he had the management of that gentleman's estate (now Mr. T. A. Reddall’s). In the course of his managerial position at "Lake House," as the homestead was then termed, Mr. Fenwick transacted all the business of the estate, including buying and selling. When the estate passed away from Captain Addison, Mr. Fenwick removed to Wollongong, where he remained but a few years, however, after which he returned to
	his first-love locality—Shellharbour. And there he has been a constant and useful resident ever since.
	<br><br>
	His present farm constitutes part of what is known as the Basset-Darley Estate, and on that he has resided about 22 years. As already remarked, he has played a useful part in the neighbourhood in which he has been so long located. He was 25 years a member of the Shellharbour Borough Council. He was three times mayor there-of. He has taken an active and forcible part in connection with all public movements in the place, including the Shellhharbour breakwater and jetty works and the local steam navigation company, which was started and carried out for years by sailing vessels. Several years ago he was appointed a magistrate of the territory. He is now in his 72nd year, and in the course of his career as an intelligent, active and observant colonist, he has witnessed many great changes that have taken place in Illawarra and other parts of the country within the last
	half century.
	<br>
	<br>
	<br>
	Granddad Fenwick’s father Robert Thomas Fenwick (1845- 1929) was the couple’s eldest
	child, born in Shellharbour almost exactly a year after they’d arrived in Australia. There were three
	other children: Charlotte, Thomas and William.
	<br><br>
	Children of Harriet Downs (1818-1894) and Thomas Fenwick (1823-1896)<br>
	1. Robert Thomas Fenwick (1845-1929) Our direct ancestor.<br>
	2. Charlotte Anne Fenwick (1847-1934) Born 1 January. Married Stephen Fryer in Kiama in

<strong>We are the descendants</strong> of Anglo-Scottish-Prusso-Germanic
Australian migrants who settled in the newly formed colonies of New South Wales and Queensland
in the nineteenth century. The idea behind these pages is to present
the stories and characters of those early settlers along with information about their origins, descendants, families, whereabouts and activities.
<br><br>
There are often themes running through their struggles and
achievements telling a tale of resourcefulness and hardships in an alien world.
The paradox of Australia as an ancient and raw continent and as a 'New World' portrays
a collision of ideals and realities yet still shows a continuity in how those people dealt with everyday life.
