    <h3><b>Who left Britain</b></h3>
    Altogether there were four branches of our British ancestors who migrated to Australia. Three of those hailed from the Scottish Highlands, Islands and Lowlands, the fourth from alongside the Scottish border whereby the Fenwicks have always claimed to be more Scottish than English.

    <h2><b>1837 Alexander and Catherine McDonald</b></h2>
    <br>
    
    Alexander Duncan McDonald and his wife Catherine Gillies departed Greenock in 1837 on July 24 aboard the Portland. The barque Portland was hired by Andrew Lang to take skilled Scottish workers to the Colony of New South Wales under the newly established Bounty System of assisted passage. They arrived in Sydney on December 3, the same year. 
    <br><br>
    On the record of their arrival, Alexander is described, at the time of embarking, as a native of London, a ship's carpenter, 22 years old and in good health. Catherine is noted as a native of Glasgow, a House Servant, 22 years old and also in good health. Andrew Lang's brother, Rev Dr John Dunmore Lang, vouched for Catherine and Rev Alex McTavish minister of the Parish of Inverchaolain did the same for Alexander.

    On the record of departure, Alexander and Catherine's previous place of residence was on the Isle of Mull in the Parish of Torosay, County Argyle. The old Parish of Torosay lay in the area surrounding Craignure in the Bay of Craignure. The town of Oban on the mainland's west coast, lies  about 18 miles across the water, west of Torosay. <br>
    A regular ferry service still runs between Oban and Craignure.

    <h2><b>1844 George and Elizabeth Rankin</b></h2>
    <br>
    
    George Rankin and his wife Elizabeth Pennycook Murray departed Greenock on board the 'Herald' on October 10, 1843. They arrived in Sydney in 1844 on January 10. The ship's records show three Rankin families were on board, the first two were from Argyle. The other, from Angus and Forfar, was made up of George, carpenter, aged 26 and Elizabeth, house servant, aged 27, both able to read and write, both from Dundee, both Presbyterian and both in good health.

    <h5>Out of Dundee</h5>
    Elizabeth's parents were recorded as Frederick and Elizabeth Murray, both deceased. George's were David and Ellen, mother alive. The Memorandum of Agreement which had been made between Alexander Berry Esq. and George Rankin and his wife Elizabeth, stated they were to be engaged as Carpenter and Laundress, and make themselves generally useful, for a period of six months.   
       
    In exchange they would be paid at the rate of £25 per annum as well as receive weekly, 14 pounds of Beef or Mutton, 16 pounds of flour, 3 pounds of sugar and two ounces of Tea. 
    <br><br>
    The record of Immigration has a note on it stating "The declaration of George Rankin does not contain the clause that he has not paid nor promised more than £1 per Statute Adult, in addition to the Bounty money, for the passage of himself and family".

    <h2><b>1844 Thomas and Harriet Fenwick</b></h2>
    <br>
    Thomas Fenwick was married to Harriet Downs on 23rd January 1841 by Rev. Ebenezer Morley at the Holborn-street Chapel in Hull. Three years later, the couple migrated to Australia with assisted passage. They left from Detport in London on March 1st, 1844 on board the 'Royal Saxon' and arrived in Port Jackson on June 20 the same year.

    The ship's records state that Thomas was a Blacksmith and Harriet a House Servant, both from Hull in Yorkshire. They were also both in very good health, could both read and write, of Episcopal faith, were without complaint and were not related to anyone in the colony. The parents of Thomas were named John and Anna and those of Harriet were named Robert and Anna.

    <h2><b>1854 Archibald, Jessie and Duncan McIntyre</b></h2>
    <br>
    
    In 1854, Jessie (Halling) McIntyre migrated to Australia with her children including her son Duncan and his new wife Isabella and their children. All in all, there were eleven McIntyres in the cabins of the barque named Exhibition when it set sail from Greenock on the 9th of October, 1853. It arrived in Sydney on a Thursday, the 2nd of March the next year.

    </div>

    <br><br>    
    The Sydney Morning Herald reported on March 3 that the Exhibition had a continuance of light winds until reaching the Cape and from thence had made the run in 35 days. Near St. Paul's, the ship lost fore-topmast and fore and main-top gallant mast. 
    <br><br>

    As far as Jessie's husband and Duncan's father, Archibald goes, there seems to be no definite knowledge of his arrival in the Colony. It is possible he arrived in Port Jackson on the 15th March 1853 on board the Prince of the Seas as a Dr. MacIntyre.

<h2 class="subtitle">About <span>Us</span></h2>
<strong>We are the descendants</strong> of Anglo-Scottish-Prusso-Germanic
Australian migrants who settled in the newly formed colonies of New South Wales and Queensland
in the nineteenth century. The idea behind these pages is to present
the stories and characters of those early settlers along with information about their origins, descendants, families, whereabouts and activities.
<br><br>
There are often themes running through their struggles and
achievements telling a tale of resourcefulness and hardships in an alien world.
The paradox of Australia as an ancient and raw continent and as a 'New World' portrays
a collision of ideals and realities yet still shows a continuity in how those people dealt with everyday life.
