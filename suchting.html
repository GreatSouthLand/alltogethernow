    As a single man, our twice great-grandfather Friedrich Süchting (later spelt Suchting), migrated to Australia. This was in 1864 from a place in the far north of Germany called Ahrensböck (now spellt Ahrensbök) in Holstein. After much upheaval, warring and political strife Holstein would later be incorporated into a newly formed German state called Schleswig-Holstein.

    <h5>Some Historical Background</h5>

    Holstein lies geographically at the lower end of the Jutland Peninsula and has a very colorful background. In 1111 Holstein became the most northern state of the Holy Roman Empire. It was originally the homeland of an ancient Saxon tribe of Germanics called the Holcetae, known as worshippers of rivers, forests, mother earth, and the Irminsul, the divine tree which acted as a great pillar connecting heaven and earth.
    <br><br>

    The tribe itself was made up of noble aristocrats, highly regarded free warriors, and a bunch of free men. Their ancient and preserved customs strictly controlled social behaviour and were intolerant towards marriage to someone of a differing social standing and especially to an outsider, even if from another of the Germanic tribes.

    <h5>Holstein in the Grip of the Sea</h5>

    Peace was not a Saxon thing and as land became scarce, they headed off in all directions to occupy someone else's, with force, and lots of it. With their own lands surrounded by sea they readily took to the water, becoming known as the pirates of both the western seaboard of the continent and the eastern seaboard of Britain. The regional names of Essex (East Saxons), Wessex (West Saxons) and Sussex (South Saxons) are remnants of the kingdoms they lorded over.
    <br><br>

    In their homeland in the Holstein area they also made their presence felt, and naturally enough this generated enemies from all sides, especially with the Danes to the north and other Germanic tribes to the south. Eventually the Saxons were defeated by the Germanics known as the Franks. That wasn't the end of it though, and warring continued but this time it was coming from the outside.
    <br><br>


    
    
    <h5>Wagria, The Promised Land<br></h5>
    
    The actual region where the Süchtings and their families were living lay in the southern part of what was once known as Wagria, in the far north of Germany and known today as Ostholstein (East Holstein). The word Wagria is derived from the Wagri, a Slavic tribe, literally meaning "the people living by the bays". In the 12th century, Count Adolf II of Schauenburg and Holstein instigated German settlement of the area, part of which was already inhabited by the Slavic migrants since the 8th century. 
    <br><br>
    The chronicler, Helmold of Bosau, wrote in 1143:<br>
    
    <div style="text-align:left; margin: 0px 0px 20px 10px;">
    <i>
    "Then a countless number of people from different tribes left, took their families and possessions with them and went with Count Adolf in Wagria to take possession of their promised land. Initially, those from Holsten were given the most sheltered area west of Segeberg, on the River Trave, on the Schwentine flood plain and everything from the Schwale to the Grimmelsberg and Lake Ploen. The country around Dargun was settled by the Westphalians, the Eutin area by the Dutch and Suesel by the Frisians. The Plön area remained uninhabited however. He allowed Oldenburg, Lütjenburg and other coastal areas be colonised by the Slavs, who had to pay taxes to him."

    <h5>Some Historical Foreground</h5>

    Following the dissolution of the Holy Roman Empire in 1806, and a national bankruptcy of Denmark in 1813, the German Confederation was finally formed in 1815. This added tension to the ongoing struggle between Prussia and Austria over regional supremacy and brewed plenty of political strife in the area of Holstein.
    <br><br>
    Yet that wasn't enough to keep the powerful busy. In the aftermath of the Napoleonic Wars with increasing unrest in the original states of the Holy Roman Empire, there was an impetus towards nationalism and the formation of a German Empire which would come into being in 1871.
    <br><br>

    Of course, before that could happen there needed to be a lot more warring. Denmark already had its paws on Schleswig and wanted Holstein to have a matching pair, but so did Prussia. From 1815 until 1864, the year Friedrich migrated, Holstein was a member of the German Confederation. King Frederick VII of Denmark died in 1863 and his replacement, Christian IX had made his claim to the throne through a female line. From another line, the Duke of Augustenborg laid claim to the Duchies of Schleswig and Holstein.

    </div>


    <br><br>
    Even though Prussia and Austria had their differences, they managed to join forces and lead the German Confederation to push the Danes back out of Schleswig and defeat that claim.

    In fact under the rule of Otto von Bismarck who had been appointed Chancellor by King Wilhelm I, Prussia went on to take over the whole of Denmark.
    <br><br>
    This was not without human trial and tribulation and gave much grief to the local inhabitants. The political and administrative changes to the place contributed greatly to an already surging flood of migration out of the place.
    <br><br>
    Many ended up migrating to America and Australia.

    <h5>The Start of a New Dynasty<br>Friedrich Suchting and Wilhelmina Riek</h5>
    One of those migrants, Friedrich Suchting, our great-great-grandfather headed for Australia, to the newly created colony of Queensland. He left Hamburg on the 'Beausite' in October 1864 and arrived at Moreton Bay in February the next year.
    <br><br>
    Only a few months later, his future wife, Wilhelmine Riek left her home in Gerswalde in Brandenburg to board the 'Helene' in Hamburg in August 1865.
    The pair of them were married on the 27th May 1870 in the small wooden Baptist Chapel in West Street Ipswich by the Baptist minister, Rev T. S. Gerrard. At the time they were both members of the Baptist Church, but that would soon change.
    <br><br>
    Friedrich, whose full name was Johann Hinrich Friedrich Süchting, was born on the 10th of March 1838 to Hinrich Thomas Süchting and Margaretha Maria Meynsen. He was 25 years old on his wedding day.
    <br><br>
    Wilhelmine's full name was Johanne Wilhelmine Emilie Riek.
    She was 18 when she married Friedrich, having been born on the 15th of February 1852 to Christian Friedrich Riek and Dorothea Louise Spann and baptised on March 7 in Gerswalde in the Uckermark, Pommerania. Strangely the record of her death says she was born on the 14th.

    Around the time that the Church of Christ was formed in Queensland, the Suchtings joined in their numbers. A new church building was opened in 1886 in Vernor near Fernvale and Friedrich was there to deliver an address. By 1902, Friedrich had been both choir-leader and preacher at Vernor for 17 years. Singing was in both German and English and sometimes, especially at a celebration held in their honour, Friedrich and Wilhelmine sang as a duet.

    At the 75th anniversary of the Fernvale State School, Frederick was remembered as being the very first school committee's secretary. That would have been in 1874, only four years after he was married.
    <br><br>
    Early in 1905, the year before Wilhelmine passed away, she had saved her son's house from being burnt down late one night. While William and Annie were away in Ipswich, a curtain had caught onto a burning candle and was set alight. Wilhelmine was the first on the scene and managed to throw the blazing curtains out the window. Only the window frame and walls were charred but the worst had been averted.

    <h5>The Next Generation</h5>

    Almost all of the children started their own families. Otto seems to have gone his own way, working at one time as a warden in the prison service and a few years later as a sawyer. Philip also was hard to track but he did live and get married in New Zealand and eventually died over there as well. What follows is a brief account of the children, starting with the eldest.

    William managed to be in the news quite a bit. In his late twenties, at a grand concert and ball under the auspices of the Rose of Fernvale Lodge of the Grand United Order of Oddfellows, he not only sang but also played violin.
    <br><br>
    On the Vernor quoits team, William together with his brothers Philip, and John who was also the team skipper, managed to beat the opposing team from Lowood. The Pieper brothers, Rudolph and Adolph, were also on the team. In the return match some weeks later, the Vernor team repeated their victory.

    and the staff of The Crown Engineering Works, Brisbane</p>
    </div>

    With his son Doug, William laid the foundation for the Crown Engineering Works where he remained working until his death in 1926. The thriving business grew and moved from the Brisbane CBD to over the river in South Brisbane. In the late 1940's it was taken over by Doug's sons John and Bill. Ever since the late 1970's John's sons Ray and Ian have been running the business.
    <br><br>

    In 1911 William was in the news again for having invented a portable cane trash cutter. In 1922, he delivered sermons upon the request of the Toowoomba Church of Christ community. As president and general scecretary for the Associated Churches of Christ he was on many committees, and was for 40 years considered to be a highly regarded and esteemed member. The news also took great interest in his sudden death upon a tram one Saturday morning when he was travelling to his city workplace from his home in Coorparoo.

    Because Frederick and his father both had the same name it is difficult to identify which person is the actual subject of a news item mentioning the name. Sometimes senior or junior was placed after the name making it clear but that didn't always happen. Otherwise, it seems that Frederick (or Friedrich) was unlike William and John and rarely in the limelight. 
    <br><br>
    Frederick was hired by the railways on December 4, 1912, with his brother Adolph having already been working there since 23rd August, 1909.
    At the time of the passing of Frederick's wife Bertha, they had been residing in Red Hill in Brisbane. His brother William and his family had also been living in Red Hill at the time.

    In November 1912, there was a surprise party held at Mr. John Suchting's home at Vernor with 50 guests singing "for they are jolly good fellows", playing games and generally having a good time. The Piepers, Muckerts, Bulows and many more could be counted amongst the visitors. 
    <br><br>
    Soon after, the family moved to Murgon, to Boat Mountain to be precise. There, in January 1924, John Suchting struck water on his property for the second time. For farmers of course, that's almost as good as striking oil. He reported that there was enough water for more stock than the property could carry.
    <br><br>

    On Easter Monday 1924 the Redgate Sports Club held a race day in Mr. C. Goschnick's paddock at Redgate near Murgon. John's wife won the Ladies' Nail Driving Contest. A couple of months later, John and Mathilda attended the Brisbane Exhibition and later visited their son Arthur working at the Beenleigh Poilce Station. They then met up with John's sister Martha and her husband August who had been touring by car, visiting Brisbane, Kalbar and the Fassifern District.

    A few months later again, John, Mathilda, Martha and August were hosts to John and Martha's brother William and his wife Anna who were holidaying in Murgon from their home in Brisbane.
    
    
    In 1925 at the fifth annual exhibition of the Murgon Pastoral, Agricultural and Horticultural Society, John won 1st place for his Cocker Spaniel bitch, and his son William had the all-round champion bitch.

    <h4><b>&raquo;&nbsp;Otto Suchting and His Wife</b></h4>
    </div>

    The first mention of Otto was when he was a groomsman at his sister Martha's wedding in 1904. That same year he was accepted into the Prison Service as a Warder, on probation. On the 11th of June, 1908 there was an announcment in the Queensland Goverment Gazette that His Excellency the Governor was pleased to direct that Warder Otto Suchting be dismissed from the Prison Service.
    <br><br>
    On Monday, February 9th 1914, there was a report in the Telegraph that "Otto Suchting, a sawyer of Narangba north coast line, severely lacerated the fingers of his right hand on Saturday morning. They were caught in a circular saw. He was brought to Brisbane by train and taken to the General Hospital".
    <br><br>
    Much later, in 1933, a 55 year old married man, named Frank Suchting, who was the foreman of a railway bridge repair gang near Strathpine, fell from the bridge and was (also) conveyed to the General Hospital. There is no record of any Frank Suchting being born, marrying or dying, so it is very likely that Otto's full name was Otto Franz Suchting and later in life went by the name of Frank.

    <h4><b>&raquo;&nbsp;Philip Suchting and Eleanor Margaret Dalliston Nash</b></h4>
    <br><br>

    Philip was listed in the Auckland West Electoral Roll for 1905 as living at Wallace Street and working as a "conductor". In 1909, still in New Zealand, he married Eleanor and in 1911 and they were living at 104 Richmond Road, Grey Lynn, a part of Auckland. At that time Philip was working as a "motorman". By 1914 they apparently had moved next door to 102 Richmond Road. In 1978, seemingly the only Suchtings listed in New Zealand are Alan and Lilian May living in Glen Eden in Auckland, a few kilometers from where Philip and Eleanor had been living.

    Martha and August were married in 1904 at the bride's parent's residence at Vernor. The bridesmaids were Miss Amelia Cronau who had made the bride's silk lustre dress and Miss Helena Adermann.
    <br><br>
    The groomsmen were August's brother Albert and Martha's brother Philip. The Suchtings, the Piepers and the Adermanns and lots more close friends and relatives were all there to join in on the celebrations.
    <br><br>
    In 1910, a party was held in their honour as it had been assumed they would soon be leaving to live in Murgon, which they did, in 1911. Martha's brother John soon followed them to Murgon with his family.
    <br><br>
    The Brisbane Courier in an article about Thriving Burnett Settlements reported at the end of 1930 that August had been in the area for more than 18 years. He had a very fine farm of 440 acres with 140 acres under cultivation and raised pigs and about 50 dairy cows.

    Alfred seemed to have had a spot of bother with domestic duties and responsibilities. One day he upped and left home, preferring to live in a tent. The newspapers were quickly on the case and followed the proceedings from the moment his wife Elizabeth had filed her complaints. By the time of the hearing for the divorce, Alfred had moved in with his 17 year old daughter Myrtle and her husband John. She was married at 16.
    <br><br>
    When asked by his wife Elizabeth if he intended to return, she was told that he wouldn't because he wouldn't be happy. In the courtroom, when asked if the woman being pointed out was his wife he said "she's supposed to be". When Elizabeth was asked if her husband was a drinker and did he work, she told the court he was a heavy drinker and he would work one week and take a month off. The decree nisi to dissolve the marriage was declared after a total of nine minutes and noted as the fastest in recent history.
    <br><br>
    To support herself Elizabeth had been working a time share dairy farm, which had been doing well. She remarried a year or so later.

<h2 class="subtitle">About <span>Us</span></h2>
<strong>We are the descendants</strong> of Anglo-Scottish-Prusso-Germanic
Australian migrants who settled in the newly formed colonies of New South Wales and Queensland
in the nineteenth century. The idea behind these pages is to present
the stories and characters of those early settlers along with information about their origins, descendants, families, whereabouts and activities.
<br><br>
There are often themes running through their struggles and
achievements telling a tale of resourcefulness and hardships in an alien world.
The paradox of Australia as an ancient and raw continent and as a 'New World' portrays
a collision of ideals and realities yet still shows a continuity in how those people dealt with everyday life.
