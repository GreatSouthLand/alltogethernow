    The Australian Fenwicks of the family started with our great-great-grandparents, Thomas and Harriet Fenwick, who migrated from Hull in 1844.

    <h5>From Kingston upon Hull and Drypool</h5>
    
    Now better known as 'Hull', Kingston upon Hull was originally an outlying part of the hamlet of Myton, named Wyke, probably derived from the Saxon word Wic meaning dwelling place or refuge. It has been told that in the 13th century, King Edward I and his hunting party followed a hare which "led them along the delightful banks of the River Hull to the hamlet of Wyke and charmed with the scene before him, viewed with delight the advantageous situation of this hitherto neglected and obscure corner. He foresaw it might become subservient both to render the kingdom more secure against foreign invasion, and at the same time greatly to enforce its commerce". Consequently, on the 1st of April, 1299, King Edward granted it a royal charter that renamed the settlement King's town upon Hull. It's interesting to note that the 'Wyke' part was still present in the earlier spelling of the name of Fenwyke.

    <br><br>
    Yet to be more precise, according to the marriage record of Thomas and Harriet, both of them were living at No. 6 Naylor's Row in Drypool, which was originally a small hamlet on the other side of the river Hull from the main township. Drypool was first mentioned in the Domesday Book as Dridpole, owned by Drogo de Bevrere, and was notoriously prone to flooding. After having been raised and drained, it became farmland and consisted of the Drypool Chapel and a few houses. In the 1680s, a citadel was built on the south side and used as a garrison until 1849. The population of Drypool in 1821 had reached 1,409 and in 1837 the hamlet and its parish were both absorbed into Kingston upon Hull. From 1837 to 1898, Drypool was part of the registration district of Sculcoates which, in 1937, was itself absorbed into Hull and Holderness districts.
    <!--br><br>
    Very little of our ancestral homeground is now left to discover. Hull was a key target in both the first and second world wars. It suffered greatly as one of the few places hit by Zeppelin raids in the first world war, but worse was to come with 95% of the buildings being damaged or destroyed by tonnes of high explosives and over 9000 incendiary bombs during the second world war. With Hull as Britain's most damaged city, many thousands of people either lost their lives or were injured and 152,000 made homeless as the result of over 80 separate air raids. -->

    The Holborn Chapel was built in 1830 as an 'Independent Church', presumably independent of main stream Church of England. On their migration records, Thomas and Harriet are described as Episcopalian.

    <br>
    THE “ROYAL SAXON”—This vessel has made one of the quickest passages of the season, only 99 days having elapsed since her leaving Cork, but her English news does not extend to so late a date as that per the Briton. Her cargo is very trifling, about a hundred hogsheads of beer being the chief article. The emigrants and vessel have a cleanly appearance, and they all seem highly pleased with the treatment received on board; there are 56 single females, 30 unmarried men, 71 children, and 94 married persons.<!-- Five infants died during the voyage, but not from any contagious disease. She has spoken nothing connected with this place, but saw the schooner at anchor near Kent’s Group reported by the Briton, supposed to be the Mary Ann, for Launceston. She will have her emigrants mustered to-day, after which it is expected she will move to the Cove.-->

    <h4>Assisted Passage to Australia</h4>
    <br>
    
    Three years after they were married, Thomas and Harriet migrated to Australia. They left Detport in London on March 1, 1844 and arrived in Port Jackson on June 20 the next year. The records of the ship on which they travelled, the Royal Saxon, reveal they left London with 'Bounty' assisted passage and an agreement to employ them at the other end, namely at Captain Addison's Peterborough Estate in Illawarra. 
    Thomas was to be employed to be a Blacksmith, and 'otherwise make himself generally useful as a farm servant' for the term of 12 calendar months. Captain Addison in return agreed to pay him a yearly salary of 16 pounds as well as to supply him with weekly rations of 12 pounds of beef or mutton, 20 pounds of flour, 3 pounds of sugar and 4 ounces of tea. At the time of her marriage, Harriet had no occupation and the Royal Saxon's records state clearly that only Thomas was employed at Captain Addison's Estate and not Harriet. Hopefully she was a good housewife and could make something out of all that Mutton, Beef, Flour and Tea, every week.

    <p>The Peterborough Estate around 1847, later to become known as Shellharbour</p>
    </div>
    
    
    <h5>The Peterborough Estate, Wollongong and Shellharbour</h5>
    
    It must have worked out well for the couple on the Peterborough Estate. In the obituary for Harriet published in The Illawarra Mercury, 23 October 1894, it was stated that Thomas had been the manager of Captain Addison's estate for nine years. He conducted all the estate's business, including buying and selling, from the 'Lake House' homestead until such time that the estate passed from Captain Addison, at which time Thomas and Harriet then moved 12 miles north to Wollongong. That would have been in 1853 but after a few years they returned to Shellharbour, as it was then known.
    <br><br>
    For five years or so, Thomas ran a business in Wollongong with another tradesman, the Wheelwright, Octavius Pollard. Until 1858, the business traded as Fenwick and Pollard, Blacksmiths and Wheelwrights, and was situated in Crown Street, Wollongong, and had its own dwelling-house. The premises were eventually taken over in 1859 and run by William Ahern and Thomas Allen, formerly of Howitt and Sons.

    <p>The Land Sales at Shellharbour</p>
    </div>
    
    Back in Shellharbour, Thomas took to farming. He selected land at Stoney Range, part of the Bassett-Darley Estate of Shellharbour, one of many estates inherited by Captain Addison's sister in law, Katherine Wentworth. As one of the nine children of D'Arcy Wentworth, Katherine inherited some of her father's huge tracts of land he left behind. At the time of his death, she was only two years old but when she grew up she first married Benjamin Darley and then William Bassett. The colonial government passed a special Private Act of Parliament, the Bassett-Darley Estates Act in 1877, to enable her to go against the conditions of her inheritance and sell the land during her lifetime.

<h2 class="subtitle">About <span>Us</span></h2>
<strong>We are the descendants</strong> of Anglo-Scottish-Prusso-Germanic
Australian migrants who settled in the newly formed colonies of New South Wales and Queensland
in the nineteenth century. The idea behind these pages is to present
the stories and characters of those early settlers along with information about their origins, descendants, families, whereabouts and activities.
<br><br>
There are often themes running through their struggles and
achievements telling a tale of resourcefulness and hardships in an alien world.
The paradox of Australia as an ancient and raw continent and as a 'New World' portrays
a collision of ideals and realities yet still shows a continuity in how those people dealt with everyday life.
