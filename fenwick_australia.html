    <h2><b>The Fenwicks in Australia</b></h2>
    <br>
    The Australian Fenwicks of the family started with our great-great-grandparents, Thomas and Harriet Fenwick, who migrated from Hull in 1844.

    <h5>From Kingston upon Hull and Drypool</h5>
    
    Now better known as 'Hull', Kingston upon Hull was originally an outlying part of the hamlet of Myton, named Wyke, probably derived from the Saxon word Wic meaning dwelling place or refuge. It has been told that in the 13th century, King Edward I and his hunting party followed a hare which "led them along the delightful banks of the River Hull to the hamlet of Wyke and charmed with the scene before him, viewed with delight the advantageous situation of this hitherto neglected and obscure corner. He foresaw it might become subservient both to render the kingdom more secure against foreign invasion, and at the same time greatly to enforce its commerce" (source: J.C.Craggs, Guide to Hull, 1817). Consequently, on the 1st of April, 1299, King Edward granted it a royal charter that renamed the settlement King's town upon Hull. It's interesting to note that the 'Wyke' part was still present in the earlier spelling of the name of Fenwyke.

    <br><br>
    Yet to be more precise, according to the marriage record of Thomas and Harriet, both of them were living at No. 6 Naylor's Row in Drypool, which was originally a small hamlet on the other side of the river Hull from the main township. Drypool was first mentioned in the Domesday Book as Dridpole, owned by Drogo de Bevrere, and was notoriously prone to flooding. After having been raised and drained, it became farmland and consisted of the Drypool Chapel and a few houses. In the 1680s, a citadel was built on the south side and used as a garrison until 1849. The population of Drypool in 1821 had reached 1,409 and in 1837 the hamlet and its parish were both absorbed into Kingston upon Hull. From 1837 to 1898, Drypool was part of the registration district of Sculcoates which, in 1937, was itself absorbed into Hull and Holderness districts.

    THE “ROYAL SAXON”—This vessel has made one of the quickest passages of the season, only 99 days having elapsed since her leaving Cork, but her English news does not extend to so late a date as that per the Briton. Her cargo is very trifling, about a hundred hogsheads of beer being the chief article. The emigrants and vessel have a cleanly appearance, and they all seem highly pleased with the treatment received on board; there are 56 single females, 30 unmarried men, 71 children, and 94 married persons.

    <h4>Assisted Passage to Australia</h4>
    <br>
    
    Three years after they were married, Thomas and Harriet migrated to Australia. They left Detport in London on March 1, 1844 and arrived in Port Jackson on June 20 the next year. The records of the ship on which they travelled, the Royal Saxon, reveal that they left London with 'Bounty' assisted passage and an agreement to employ them at the other end, namely at Captain Addison's Peterborough Estate in Illawarra. Thomas was to be employed as a Blacksmith, and 'otherwise make himself generally useful as a farm servant' for the term of 12 calendar months. 
    
    <div class="lbox" style="width:40%; margin:20px 20px 10px 0px;">

    <img src="img/fenwick_aus/1847_peterborough.jpg" alt="">
    </a>
    <p>The Peterborough Estate partitioned into five parts marked A to E, which were allocated to the five inheritors who drew lots to determine ownership. <br>
    <br>
    The circled area indicates the location of the Lake House from where Thomas was managing the estate for Captain Addison.
    <br><br>
    The small cross-hatched area on the coast was first known as Peterborough Village and then Shellharbour Township. The whole of the area later became known as Shellharbour. <br>
    <br>

    </div>
    
    Captain Addison in return agreed to pay him a yearly salary of 16 pounds sterling as well as to supply him with weekly rations of 12 pounds of beef or mutton, 20 pounds of flour, 3 pounds of sugar and 4 ounces of tea.     
    
    At the time of her marriage, Harriet had no occupation but for the assisted passage on the Royal Saxon's records she is recorded as a House Servant. Only Thomas was employed at Captain Addison's Estate and not Harriet. Hopefully she knew what to do with all that mutton, beef, flour and tea, every week.
    
    
    <h5>The Wentworths and Peterborough Estate</h5>
    
    The lives of Thomas and Harriet Fenwick were not only tied to the fortunes of Peterborough Estate but also directly and indirectly to the family members who inherited it, the Wentworths.The 13,050 acre estate was itself part of over 34,000 acres accrued by the self-styled wealthy and colorful colonial figure, D'Arcy Wentworth, the largest land owner in the Colony of New South Wales at the time of his death. Among other things, he was also Principal Surgeon, Chief Magistrate, Superintendant of Police and Co-founder of the Bank of New South Wales.
    
    <br><br>
    D'Arcy was the husband of the famous author, Jane Austin, who remained married to him, even though he had a total of twelve children to two other women.  
    
    His eldest children, William, Dorset (called D'Arcy), Matthew (called John) and Martha, were born to Catherine Crowley, a convict who died in 1800. 
    
    The rest of the children, George, Martha, Sophia, Robert, John, Mary-Ann, Katherine and Charles, were all born to Ann Lawes who was actually still the wife of James McNeal, whom she married when she was fifteen. 
    
    Upon his death on July 5, 1827, all of D'Arcy Wentworth's properties were bound up in a rather obscure manner and held in trust to the benefit of his seven children who survived him.
    
    The part of that inheritance which is relevant here is the Peterborough Estate, which was left to five of the children as tenants in common, meaning that they couldn't inherit from one another.<br>
    <br> 
    
    Those five children were:
    <div class="display-table noline" style="width:100%; margin:6px 0px 0px 0px; padding:0px;">
    
    <div><div>Robert</div><div> who ran into so much debt that his shares were eventually acquired by his brothers-in-law, Towns and Addision.</div></div>
    
    <div><div>Martha</div><div> who married John Reddall whose son, Thomas Reddall, was a member of the Shellharbour Council alongside Thomas Fenwick.</div></div>
    
    <div><div>Sophia</div><div> who married Robert Towns, the owner of the Royal Saxon which took Thomas and Harriet to New South Wales. Also on board were Robert's wife Sophia Wentworth and her sister Katherine Wentworth. Robert Towns is honored by having Townsville named after him.</div></div>
    
    <div><div>Mary&#8209;Ann</div><div> who first married Stephen Addison, for whom Thomas was estate manager for 9 years. Mary-Ann later married Charles Hollings.</div></div>
    
    <div><div>Katherine</div><div> who first married Benjamin Darley, a business associate of Robert Towns. She later married William Bassett. Those two surnames appear on the Shellharbour Bassett-Darley Estate where Thomas and Harriet spent the last 20 or so years of their conjugal bliss. The government passed a special Private Act of Parliament, the Bassett-Darley Estates Act in 1877, to enable Katherine to unlock the conditions of her inheritance and sell the lands during her lifetime.</div></div>

    <h5>Peterborough, Wollongong and Shellharbour</h5>
    
    It must have worked out well for the couple on the Peterborough Estate. In the obituary for Harriet published in The Illawarra Mercury, 23 October 1894, it was stated that Thomas had been the manager of Captain Addison's estate for nine years. He conducted all the estate's business, including buying and selling, from the 'Lake House' homestead (shown circled in map above) until such time that the estate passed from Captain Addison. Thomas and Harriet then moved 10 miles north to Wollongong. That would have been about 1853 but after a few years they returned to Shellharbour, as it was then known.
    <br><br>
    For five years or so, Thomas ran a business in Wollongong with another tradesman, the Wheelwright, Octavius Pollard. Until 1858, the business traded as Fenwick and Pollard, Blacksmiths and Wheelwrights, and was situated in Crown Street, Wollongong. The premises, which included its own dwelling-house, were eventually taken over in 1859 and run by William Ahern and Thomas Allen, formerly of Howitt and Sons.
    <br><br>

    <img src="img/fenwick_aus/shellharbour_logo.jpg" alt="">
    </a>
    </div>
    
    Back in Shellharbour, Thomas took up farming as well as being a council alderman for 25 years, during which time he was elected as mayor no less than three times. He also upheld the law as a magistrate, a Justice of the Peace, or J.P. for short. 
   
    The farm at Stoney Range, which Thomas held for 27 years up until his death, was part of what was known as the Bassett-Darley Estate of Shellharbour. As mentioned earlier, it was one of many estates inherited, in part, by Captain Addison's wife Mary-Ann Wentworth and four of her siblings.

<h2 class="subtitle">About <span>Us</span></h2>
<strong>We are the descendants</strong> of Anglo-Scottish-Prusso-Germanic
Australian migrants who settled in the newly formed colonies of New South Wales and Queensland
in the nineteenth century. The idea behind these pages is to present
the stories and characters of those early settlers along with information about their origins, descendants, families, whereabouts and activities.
<br><br>
There are often themes running through their struggles and
achievements telling a tale of resourcefulness and hardships in an alien world.
The paradox of Australia as an ancient and raw continent and as a 'New World' portrays
a collision of ideals and realities yet still shows a continuity in how those people dealt with everyday life.
