    <b>A Tale of Two Entire Families</b> - Part 3
    <br><br>

    <p>There are lots of McIntyres who went to Australia including our direct ancestors Archibald and Jessie belonging to the Kilmonivaig Mcintyres who are covered elsewhere. They eventually met up with the Glenartney McIntyre family members who had arrived in the colony a little earlier.
    Archibald's brothers William, Donald, and Duncan Kennedy all took to buying up land in the new colony. William, as was mentioned elsewhere married Mary, one of the Glenartney McIntyres. They built themselves a 22 room house on their Pitnacree Estate which Mary had inherited from her brother Peter.

    <h5>Brushy Hill near Musclebrook</h5>

    Soon after their arrival in Sydney, Archibald and Jessie moved to Maitland in the Hunter Valley where Archibald's brother William had already established a home and school. Over the course of a few years, Jessie gradually acquired land at Brushy Hill near Musclebrook (later called Muswellbrook) in the Upper Hunter Valley.
    <br><br>
    The five parcels of adjoining lands gradually became known as a property called Bethel.

    <h5>What's in a Name?</h5>
    
    <a href="img/archibald/bethel.png">
    <img src="img/archibald/bethel.png" alt="" style="width:35%;" class="f-right">
    </a>
    Eventually the name Bethel was chosen for the property established at Brushy Hill. It's a curious name and since there is not much to go on when researching what Archibald and Jessie were up to in Australia, it's probably worth investigating.
    <br><br>
    Most people arriving in the colony of New South Wales had a tendency to name their new property after some place they had left behind in the old country. Originally people were being located in the countryside according to these property names but later as towns and cities grew up around the earlier settlements, street names and street numbers became more important. Archibald and Jessie were amongst the last settlers to call their property by a name. But life in the colony was not easy. Archibald's brother John died in April 1857. In September 1860 as a result of injuries he incurred at the Maitland Riots, brother Donald also died. Soon afterwards in May of 1861, Jessie's mother back in in Scotland also passed away and then as a final blow after only another four months, Archibald himself died.



    <!--By 1860, Archibald's brothers John and Donald had both died and Archibald himself soon followed in 1861. For Jessie there was even more hardship having her mother in Scotland die only four months earlier.-->

    <b>Left:</b> The epitaph on Archibald's headstone reads:<br>
    <i>So teach us to number our days that we may apply our hearts unto wisdom. PS XC:12.</i>


    <br><br>
    The name "Bethel" has quite obviously something biblical about it and it seems to hold some sort of hidden message. Hidden in the sense that they must have known what it meant but were leaving it up to everyone else to figure it out. In the Bible there are many references to Bethel as a House of God, or a place where there was a ladder to God, but that still doesn't offer up much of a starting point.

    <br><!--br>
    <b>Bethel in the Books of Ezra and Nehemiah</b-->
    <br>
    <!--i>Only Jerusalem is mentioned more frequently than Bethel in the Old Testament.</i>

    (gotquestions.org)
    <br><br-->
    Wikipedia says: <i>Bethel is mentioned in Ezra 2:28 and Nehemiah 7:32 as being resettled at the time of the return of the exiles from Babylon.</i>

    The word "resettled" seems to strike a chord, as Archibald and Jessie were definitely early Australian settlers. Indeed, in the Postal Directory for New South Wales, Jessie had herself listed at Brushy Hill as "Mrs A. McIntyre, settler". So that could mean that they had left behind them a Babylon of sorts. Babylon of course was an ancient empire and perhaps it was just simply a quip about Scotland or Britain being the "old country", an ancient empire.

    <span style="white-space: pre; font-family: monospace;">
    Duncan, the eldest son of Archibald and Jessie, married three times.
      All three wives were Catholics.
      The first was Scottish.
      The second was Irish.
      The third was born in Australia to Scottish parents.
      His third wife was the sister of John McDonald, the husband of his eldest daughter, Jessie.
      Duncan survived all three of his wives.


    Duncan married his 1st wife, Isabella Kelly (1832-1863) in Edinburgh on 12.02.1851
    and they had the following children:

      Archibald Royston 1852–21.03.1922 m. Clida Blanch Gulliver 05.05.1880 (Wardell)
      Donald        1853–12.05.1876 died unmarried, from tuberculosis
      Joseph        1855–1857     died less than 2 years old at Millers Point, Sydney
      Duncan Joseph     1858–24.11.1937 m. Jessie Hay Cameron 13.04.1892 (Sydney) died North Sydney
      Jessie Halling    1860–10.01.1911 m. John McDonald 17.07.1911 (Wardell) died Bexhill
      William Kellie    1862–1934     died unmarried, in Scone close to his grandma Jessie

    The first three children were born in Edinburgh, the others at Millers Point, Sydney.
    Upon arrival from Scotland, Duncan and Isabella lived at Millers Point in Sydney
    where Duncan practised his profession as a master baker.
    After Duncan' mother-in-law Catherine died in May of 1861 and Duncan's father in September, he
    turned up at his mother's place in Bethel near Scone presumably to look after the legals.
    Isabella died aged 31 in Sydney 6 dec 1863, possibly from an illness or from giving birth.
    Duncan then moved to the Nothern Rivers and possibly left his children with his mother.


    Duncan married his 2nd wife, Ellen Kirby (1840-1875) in Pimlico on 23.10.1865
    and they had the following children:

      Ellen Isabella 11.08.1866–26.09.1943 m. Ernest Charles Miller 03.01.1885 (Rocky Mouth) d. Rozelle
      Flora McDonald 27.06.1869–10.07.1946 m. John William Benson 06.04.1892 (Wardell) d. Tweed Heads
      John Angus     10.03.1870–07.05.1950 m. Frances Clara McColm 27.04.1896 (Summer Hill) d. Sydney
      Allan Roy    07.01.1873–23.05.1950 m. Alice Maude Sayers 05.09.1894 (Kogarah) d. Waverley

    The first child, Ellen was born in Pimlico, Flora in Wardell, John and Allan in Ballina.
    Duncan allegedly supervised the building of a ship in Pimlico.
    He then moved to Wardell and literally set up shop there, his first being on one side
    of the Richmond River and then another on the other side at East Wardell.
    He supposedly ran ships, moving produce outbound and merchandise back into the Northern Rivers.
    Duncan also had his hands in many land and property transactions, including mills and a hotel.
    Upon Duncan's retirement, Allan Roy took over the shop business.
    Ellen died aged 34 on 3rd January 1875 and Duncan remarried a few months later.


    Duncan married his 3rd wife, Elizabeth May McDonald (1848-1913) in Broadwater on 19.05.1875
    and they had the following children:

      Clarence Duncan     15.02.1876–01.07.1946 m. Annie May West 1898 (Balmain) d. Kogerah
      Elizabeth McDonald  14.02.1878–17.01.1950 m. Michael Thomas Morris 02.07.1898 (Wardell) d. Rose Bay
      Eliza Clinton Neild 22.05.1879–21.04.1961 m. Thomas Mulhearn 1898 (Ballina) d. Sydney
      Joanna Campbell     1880–31.12.1951 m. William Rudgley 1898 (Ballina) d. Brisbane
      Eglantine Balfour   26.04.1883–26.04.1915 possibly unmarried, d. Balmain
      Malcolm McKinnon Campbell 01.10.1885–19.09.1944 m. Lorna Louise Gunter 1921 (Rockdale)
      Alexander Duncan    07.07.1886–13.07.1886 died in Wardell, six days old
      Clara Georgina    18.07.1887–02.03.1954​​ m. William Frayling Talbot 1917 (Sydney) d. Sydney
      Olive Rachael     06.07.1889–22.06.1972 m. Ernest James Cochrane 18.08.1928 (Sydney) d. St.Leonards
      Roderick Dhu      15.12.1891–24.12.1927 m. Constance Edith Jackson 03.08.1918 (Sydney) d. Sydney

    All the children were born in Wardell except for Roderick Dhu who was born at Randwick.
    Upon Duncan's death four of his children from the last marriage became executors of his estate
    but there was a caveat that the estate couldn't be sold for a specified number of years.
    The youngest child Roderick Dhu was left 20 pounds and successfully sued the estate for more.
    When Duncan's mother died in 1887, he and his brother John Archibald became executors of her estate.
    They sold her grazing property called Bethel and distributed the funds.
    Elizabeth May died aged 64 in Ryde 24 August 1913.
    Duncan died aged 86 in Wardell 16 September 1916.

<h2 class="subtitle">About <span>Us</span></h2>
<strong>We are the descendants</strong> of Anglo-Scottish-Prusso-Germanic
Australian migrants who settled in the newly formed colonies of New South Wales and Queensland
in the nineteenth century. The idea behind these pages is to present
the stories and characters of those early settlers along with information about their origins, descendants, families, whereabouts and activities.
<br><br>
There are often themes running through their struggles and
achievements telling a tale of resourcefulness and hardships in an alien world.
The paradox of Australia as an ancient and raw continent and as a 'New World' portrays
a collision of ideals and realities yet still shows a continuity in how those people dealt with everyday life.
