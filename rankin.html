    <h5>From Old Dundee to New South Wales</h5>
    
    Our Australian branch of the Rankin family all started with George Rankin, a carpenter from Dundee. George married Elizabeth Pennycook Murray in 1839 and the couple migrated to New South Wales in 1844 on board the 'Herald' from Greenock.
    <br><br>
    The story of the Rankins reaches back further though. George was born in Dundee on July 13, 1815 as the only son of David Rankin (1788-1831) and Hellen Thom (or Thoms) (born 1787) who were married in Dundee three years earlier on March 16, 1812. On the monument they erected to remember Hellen, their first child, David Rankin was recorded as being a Wright, in Dundee. "The term 'Wright' comes from the circa 700 AD Old English word 'wryhta' or 'wyrhta', meaning worker or shaper of wood. 'Wright' is still used in Scottish English in the original meaning of 'skilled woodworker'. Wright is also an anglicised version of the Scots Gaelic clan name 'MacIntyre' or 'Mac an t-Saoir'." (source: Wikipedia)
    <br><br>
    George's wife Elizabeth, also a native of Dundee, was born on September 24, 1815 as the eldest child of Frederick Murray and Isabella Baden (or Badden). Frederick is mentioned a number of times as being a linen weaver in Dundee. Weaving was a thriving industry for centuries in Dundee, having its greatest successes with wool, then flax for linen and after that jute which lasted until the end of the 20th century.

    <h5>The Howff</h5>
    
    To comprehend the presence of the Rankin family in Dundee, it's helpful to start building a picture of Dundee itself, and of the Rankins who lived and died there. Some records of great interest are those of the Howff. 
    <br><br>
    The Old Howff Burying Ground dates back to at least 1564, when Mary, Queen of Scots granted the land which once belonged to the Greyfriar Monks, to the Burgh of Dundee. 'Howff' is a word in the Scots language, likely derived from the German word 'Hof', meaning courtyard or enclosed space. Members of the Incorporated Trades of Dundee had used the Howff as a meeting place until 1776. The last burial in the Old Howff took place in 1878.
    <br><br>
    The New Howff was opened in 1834, having been modelled on the Glasgow Necropolis. It was eventually carved up and destroyed by the construction of roads, car parks and railways. Very little of it remains. On the other hand, the Old Howff has been preserved and is now part of Scottish National Heritage. About 80,000 people are recorded as having been buried there since the 1770's, when records started to be made. Before that time, there would have been many more. Yet, there are only between 1000 and 2000 stone monuments, so to have a gravestone at all is distinctly a statement of wealth.
    <br><br>
    Consequently, in 1814, when George's parents, David and Hellen, had a stone erected in memory of their infant daughter Hellen who had died at the age of 1 year and 4 months, the family must have been in the money. That would have changed dramatically in 1831 when David, as the sole money earner, died.

    <h4><b>The Rankins and The Murrays <br> and Boy (George) meets Girl (Elizabeth)</b></h4>
    <br>
    
    The earliest traceable Rankin (or Rankan) ancestor in our line, was our 5x great-grandfather, John Rankan, whose wife was Helen Dick. Their eldest son, David Rankan, was born in Barry, about 9km east of Dundee. David's wife, Ann Salmond, was born in Carmyllie, about 7km north-east of Barry. David and Ann's son, who was also called David, was born in Monikie, and as can be seen from the map to the right, is a place roughly halfway between the birthplaces of his parents.
    <br><br>
    The Salmond family line can be traced back further, all the way to Thomas Salmond, our 9x great-grandfather, who was born in 1628. For seven generations the descendants kept close to Carmyllie, venturing sometimes to marry someone from the neighbouring Monikie or Dunnichen. As time progressed, the pull towards Dundee was too great.
    <br><br>
    The same phenomenon happened to Elizabeth Pennycook Murray's ancestors. There was a gradual progression from Perthshire towards Dundee with its booming weaving industry. Dundee is where both George and Elizabeth were born. Yet only a few years after having met in their early twenties, it seems that George, the son of a Wright, and Elizabeth, the daughter of a Weaver, somehow became restless enough to go further abroad, to Australia.
    <br><br>
    There are some other major factors to consider though. In 1826, when George was about 11 years old, cholera broke out in Dundee and in an attempt to contain the outbreak, the council acquired a tenement building, formerly used to house sailors, and remodelled it into a Cholera Hospital to isolate the infection. The cholera subsided but in 1831/32 came back with a vengeance. The town's newspaper recorded some time afterwards that one doctor anonymously reported that in 1832 over 5000 people died from the disease in under 6 months.
    <br><br>
    The Church records of burials at that time show only a fraction of that number but it is known that there were cholera pits in the Howff cemetery because there was not enough time for proper burials. How many of the Rankins and their relatives succumbed to the disease will probably never be known. George's father died in 1831 of a 'bowel complaint' which could have been cholera related. As well as that, George's two elder siblings are known to have died in infancy, yet it's possible that all his other siblings were also lost to some sickness or another. Elizabeth's parents were both no longer living by 1844 even though they would have only been in their fifties by then.

    <h4><b>David Rankan (1755–) and Ann Salmond (1756–)</b></h4>
    <br>
    
    On record, the parents of the David Rankin who was born in 1786, were David Rankan and Ann Salmond but there is no record available for their marriage. On the other hand, Ann Salmond had a sister, Barbara, who was 2 years younger and who married a David Rankin, first in Carmyllie on 12 August 1785 and again on 14 August 1785 in Panbride. There is no record of a David Rankin and a Barbara Salmond having any children, but the birthdate of 1786 matches. Regarding the two marriages, it was common practice at the time for a couple in Scotland to have a ceremony at the locations of both sets of parents. Barbara's (and Ann's) parents were both from Carmyllie, where the first marriage took place. David's older sister Jean, was born in Panbride, the location of the second ceremony.
    
    <br><br>
    Ann Salmond came from a long line of Carmyllie residents. The parish, Carmyllie, is about three by five miles in size and contains two villages, Redford and Greystone. The area was once famous for producing Carmyllie Stone, high quality and varied sandstone and slate ideally suited for roof covering, building, steps, paving and flooring. The quarried and finished stone was transported to the surrounding shires as well as England, the Continent, North and South America, Australia and the Colonies. There were quarries in the surrounding districts as well, but the ones in Carmyllie were centuries old, making them the oldest quarries in Scotland.

    <h4><b>Frederick Murray (1787–1842) and Isabella Baden (1786–)</b></h4>
    <br>
    Elizabeth Pennycook Murray belongs to one of the Murray families scattered throughout Perthshire. Her father Frederick (or Frederic) was born in Easter Bleaton, an old hamlet just north of Blairgowrie and east of Blair Atholl, the seat of one of Perthshire's most famous Murray families, The Dukes of Atholl. That family is also related to the Murrays of Ochtertyre,  with George and Patrick Murray being mentioned in our story of the McIntyres of Glenartney. Many more strands of the Murrays are woven into our family history. Whether or not the 'poor' Murrays of our family are related to the 'rich' Murrays alongside them is a point for speculation but one thing is for sure, the name Murray pops up almost everwhere our ancestors have been in Scotland.
    <br><br>
    <!--
    Interestingly, when trying to research the origin of Frederick's wife's family name, Baden (sometimes spelt Badden) the trail always seems to fall back on Baden, now part of Baden-Württemberg, in Germany, the other part of which, Württemberg, being the origin of a lot of our German ancestors.

<p><strong>We are the descendants</strong> of Anglo-Scottish-Prusso-Germanic
Australian migrants who settled in the newly formed colonies of New South Wales and Queensland
in the nineteenth century. The idea behind these pages is to present
the stories and characters of those early settlers along with information about their origins, descendants, families, whereabouts and activities.<br><br>

There are often themes running through their struggles and
achievements telling a tale of resourcefulness and hardships in an alien world.
The paradox of Australia as an ancient and raw continent and as a 'New World' portrays
a collision of ideals and realities yet still shows a continuity in how they dealt with everyday life.
