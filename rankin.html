    <h5>From Old Dundee to New South Wales</h5>

    Our Australian branch of the Rankin family all started with George Rankin, a carpenter from Dundee. George married Elizabeth Pennycook Murray in 1839 and the couple migrated to New South Wales in 1844 on board the 'Herald' from Greenock.
    <br><br>
    The story of the Rankins reaches back further though. George was born in Dundee on July 13, 1815 as the only son of David Rankin (1788-1831) and Hellen Thom (or Thoms) (born 1787) who were married in Dundee three years earlier on March 16, 1812. On the monument they erected to remember Hellen, their first child, David Rankin was recorded as being a Wright, in Dundee. "The term 'Wright' comes from the circa 700 AD Old English word 'wryhta' or 'wyrhta', meaning worker or shaper of wood. 'Wright' is still used in Scottish English in the original meaning of 'skilled woodworker'. Wright is also an anglicised version of the Scots Gaelic clan name 'MacIntyre' or 'Mac an t-Saoir'." (source: Wikipedia)
    <br><br>
    George's wife Elizabeth, also a native of Dundee, was born on September 24, 1815 as the eldest child of Frederick Murray and Isabella Baden (or Badden). Frederick is mentioned a number of times as being a linen weaver in Dundee. Weaving was a thriving industry for centuries in Dundee, having its greatest successes with wool, then flax for linen and after that jute which lasted until the end of the 20th century.

    <h5>The Howff</h5>

    To comprehend the presence of the Rankin family in Dundee, it's helpful to start building a picture of Dundee itself, and of the Rankins who lived and died there. Some records of great interest are those of the Howff.
    <br><br>
    The Old Howff Burying Ground dates back to at least 1564, when Mary, Queen of Scots granted the land which once belonged to the Greyfriar Monks, to the Burgh of Dundee. 'Howff' is a word in the Scots language, likely derived from the German word 'Hof', meaning courtyard or enclosed space. Members of the Incorporated Trades of Dundee had used the Howff as a meeting place until 1776. The last burial in the Old Howff took place in 1878.
    <br><br>
    The New Howff was opened in 1834, having been modelled on the Glasgow Necropolis. It was eventually carved up and destroyed by the construction of roads, car parks and railways. Very little of it remains. On the other hand, the Old Howff has been preserved and is now part of Scottish National Heritage. About 80,000 people are recorded as having been buried there since the 1770's, when records started to be made. Before that time, there would have been many more. Yet, there are only between 1000 and 2000 stone monuments, so to have a gravestone at all is distinctly a statement of wealth.
    <br><br>
    Consequently, in 1814, when George's parents, David and Hellen, had a stone erected in memory of their infant daughter Hellen who had died at the age of 1 year and 4 months, the family must have been in the money. That would have changed dramatically in 1831 when David, as the sole money earner, died.

    <h4><b>The Rankins and The Murrays
    <!-- <br> and Boy (George) meets Girl (Elizabeth)-->
    </b></h4>
    <br>

    The earliest traceable Rankin (or Rankan) ancestor in our line, was our 5x great-grandfather, John Rankan, whose wife was Helen Dick. Their eldest son, David Rankan, was born in Barry, about 9km east of Dundee. David's wife, Ann Salmond, was born in Carmyllie, about 7km north-east of Barry. David and Ann's son, who was also called David, was born in Monikie, and as can be seen from the map to the right, is a place roughly halfway between the birthplaces of his parents.
    <br><br>
    The Salmond family line can be traced back further, all the way to Thomas Salmond, our 9x great-grandfather, who was born in 1628. For seven generations the descendants kept close to Carmyllie, venturing sometimes to marry someone from the neighbouring Monikie or Dunnichen. As time progressed, the pull towards Dundee was too great.
    <br><br>
    The same phenomenon happened to Elizabeth Pennycook Murray's ancestors. There was a gradual progression from Perthshire towards Dundee with its booming weaving industry. Dundee is where both George and Elizabeth were born. Yet only a few years after having met in their early twenties, it seems that George, the son of a Wright, and Elizabeth, the daughter of a Weaver, somehow became restless enough to go further abroad, to Australia.
    <br><br>
    There are some other major factors to consider though. In 1826, when George was about 11 years old, cholera broke out in Dundee and in an attempt to contain the outbreak, the council acquired a tenement building, formerly used to house sailors, and remodelled it into a Cholera Hospital to isolate the infection. The cholera subsided but in 1831/32 came back with a vengeance. The town's newspaper recorded some time afterwards that one doctor anonymously reported that in 1832 over 5000 people died from the disease in under 6 months.
    <br><br>
    The Church records of burials at that time show only a fraction of that number but it is known that there were cholera pits in the Howff cemetery because there was not enough time for proper burials. How many of the Rankins and their relatives succumbed to the disease will probably never be known. George's father died in 1831 of a 'bowel complaint' which could have been cholera related. As well as that, George's two elder siblings are known to have died in infancy, yet it's possible that all his other siblings were also lost to some sickness or another. Elizabeth's parents were both no longer living by 1844 even though they would have only been in their fifties by then.

    <h4><b>David Rankan (1755–) and Ann Salmond (1756–)</b></h4>
    <br>

    On record, the parents of the David Rankin who was born in 1788, were David Rankan and Ann Salmond but there is no record available for their marriage. On the other hand, Ann Salmond had a sister, Barbara, who was 2 years younger and who married a David Rankin, first in Carmyllie on 12 August 1785 and again on 14 August 1785 in Panbride. There is no record of a David Rankin and a Barbara Salmond having any children, but the birthdate of 1786 matches. Regarding the two marriages, it was common practice at the time for a couple in Scotland to have a ceremony at the locations of both sets of parents. Barbara's (and Ann's) parents were both from Carmyllie, where the first marriage took place. David's older sister Jean, was born in Panbride, the location of the second ceremony.

    <br><br>
    Ann Salmond came from a long line of Carmyllie residents. The parish, Carmyllie, is about three by five miles in size and contains two villages, Redford and Greystone. The area was once famous for producing Carmyllie Stone, high quality and varied sandstone and slate ideally suited for roof covering, building, steps, paving and flooring. The quarried and finished stone was transported to the surrounding shires as well as England, the Continent, North and South America, Australia and the Colonies. There were quarries in the surrounding districts as well, but the ones in Carmyllie were centuries old, making them the oldest quarries in Scotland.

    <br><br>
    The most famous Murrays of Perthshire are those near Blairgowrie at Blair Atholl, the seat of the Dukes of Atholl. That family is also related to the Murrays of Ochtertyre,  with George and Patrick Murray being mentioned in our story of the McIntyres of Glenartney. Many more strands of the Murrays are woven into our family history. 
    <br><br>
    Whether or not the 'poor' Murrays of our family are related to the 'rich' Murrays alongside them is a point for speculation but one thing is for sure, the name Murray pops up almost everwhere our ancestors have been in Scotland.

    <h2><b>The Rankins in Australia</b></h2>
    <br>


    When George Rankin and his wife Elizabeth Pennycook nee Murray arrived in Australia early in 1844, they immediately moved about 70 miles south of Sydney to a place called Jamberoo in the district of Shoalhaven. Although the area was called Shoalhaven it was in fact closer to what later became Shellharbour which was at that time known as Peterborough Estate. Their reason for going to Jamberoo can be discovered by examining the work agreement made five days after they arrived, namely to take up working as carpenter and laundress for Alexander Berry Esquire, a businessman whose main office was in George street, Sydney.
    <br>

    <p>Alexander Berry (1781–1873)</p>
    </div>

    <h6 style="color:#608020;">Alexander Berry</h6>

    Alexander Berry had a rather colourful and eventful background. He was born in 1783 on the Dundee side of Cupar in Fifeshire, Scotland, only a hop, step and a jump (ten miles) away from where George and Elizabeth were born and raised. He studied at St. Andrews and Edinburgh Universities to become a ship's surgeon, and at 24 accepted a commission with the East India Company. The young man's enthusiasm quickly turned to distress over the cruel conditions of nautical life as well as that of his profession. He resigned his position, chartered a ship, and set off for adventure to the Cape of Good Hope and a world of commerce. While in South Africa, he heard of the famine in the newly formed Colony of New South Wales and decided to fill his ship with provisions and head off.

    (also known as Cullingatty, Cullengatty, Coloomgatty, Cullingatta, Coolungatta, Coolongatta, Coolloomgatta, Cooloomgata)</p>
    </div>

    Later while passing through Cadiz on one of his trips to London, Alexander Berry met Edward Wollstonecraft who not only became his London and then Sydney-side business partner, but also his brother-in-law when Alexander later married Edward's sister, Elizabeth. The Auntie of Edward and Elizabeth was the English writer and advocate of women's rights, Mary Wollstonecraft whose daughter, Mary Wollstonecraft (Godwin) Shelley, was the author of the novel 'Frankenstein'.
    <br><br>
    The two business partners arranged with the colonial office to be the first settlers of the coastal area south of Sydney. When Alexander returned to London to finalise arrangements and charter another vessel loaded with supplies, he brought back with him another Scot, the new Governor of New South Wales, Thomas Brisbane. Ten thousand acres and a hundred convicts were given to Berry and Wollstonecraft to establish their estate near the Shoalhaven River which they called Coolangatta, from a local Aboriginal word meaning 'splendid view'.
    <br><br>
    Over the years the Coolangatta estate was increased to over 65000 acres with help from Berry's brothers, especially David, who eventually managed and inherited everything, becoming Australia's first official millionaire. The Queensland town of Coolangatta was named after  Alexander Berry's ship of that name, which was wrecked near there. The modern day town of Berry which was part of the Coolangatta estate, was renamed in 1889 to honour of the Berry family. Originally Berry was known as Broughton Creek, a place which will turn up later in our story of George and Elizabeth Rankin.

    In 1843, Henrietta Heathorn, who later married the famous biologist and anthropologist, T.H. Huxley, described her trip to Jamberoo. Henrietta was the daughter of Henry Heathorn,
    the manager of Woodstock Brewery and Mill at Jamberoo and was possibly George Rankin's boss.

    <br>
    <i>
    From Wollongong to Jamberoo, the road was a mere day track through a forest of tropical foliage; gum trees 200 [feet] or more in height, gigantic India-rubber trees with broad shining green leaves, lofty cabbage palms, and many other kinds of tree towered above us, so that their tops made a twilight canopy, impenetrable to the sunlight, save for an infrequent clearing in the forest made by the settler’s axe. Huge lianas, some as thick as a man’s arm, hung down snakelike from the trees.
    </i>
    <br>

    <h6 style="color:#608020;">George in the Jungle</h6>
    By the 1850's, after a number of years at Jamberoo, George and Elizabeth settled deeper into the Coolangatta Estate at the main settlement of Broughton Creek. Later still, they made their way closer to Shellharbour, or Peterborough Estate as it was known.

    Only a few months after George and Elizabeth arrived in the Colony, two more of our ancestors, Thomas and Harriet Fenwick had turned up at the Peterborough Estate. Their son, Robert Fenwick ended up marrying George and Elizabeth's daughter, Hellen Rankin. Hellen and Robert became our great-grandparents. When Thomas and Harriet moved to Wollongong, 17 miles north of Shellharbour, George and Elizabeth did too. Again when Thomas and Harriet returned to Shellharbour, George and Elizabeth were there as well.

    </div>
    <br><br>

    George set up business as a contractor, first repairing and rebuilding, then taking on large projects such as building bridges and wharves with his sons, David and Frederick under the business name of George Rankin and Sons. Many of the contracts went through the Shellharbour Council where Thomas was three times Mayor so that's likely how the two families made contact.
    <br><br>


    Around 1872, the eldest son of George and Elizabeth, David, managed to get a bridge building contract further north in the Clarence River district. George and family followed, and so did Thomas's eldest son, Robert Fenwick with his wife Hellen. From there they all stuck together as they moved their way further northwards until reaching the Richmond River district, close to where another of our ancestors, Duncan McIntyre, was settled at Wardell. At least one of David Rankin's children, Ernest Charles David, was born in Wardell.
    <br><br>

    Later, David and then George settled at Bexhill, alongside Corndale where Duncan McIntyre's daughter, our great-grandmother Jessie (McIntyre) McDonald, lived out the rest of her days, till she passed away in 1916. As a matter of further coincidence, Duncan McIntyre's father-in-law, Joseph Kelly, was buried in the Dundee Howff where many of the Rankin family members came to their final rest.

    <h4><b>The Places of the Rankins</b></h4>
    As bridge builders, the Rankins moved around quite a lot and here are some of those places.
    <br><br>

    <h6 style="color:#608020;">Jamberoo, Illawarra District</h6>
    The first place where George and Elizabeth lived in Australia was Jamberoo, a settlement which grew up around the cedar cutting of the early nineteenth century. The village of Jamberoo lies at the western end of the Minnamurra Swamp and is nestled in the steep sided valley of the Minnamurra River. As such, it is not subjected to the extreme weather which happens, for instance, in the nearby Albion Park.

    <h6 style="color:#608020;">Broughton Creek / Berry, Illawarra District</h6>
    In the 1860's George and Elizabeth were living near. or in. the village of Broughton Creek, later renamed Berry. As early as 1860, there was an advertisement in the Illawarra Mercury that the lease on the farm occupied by George Rankin was up for sale. Broughton Creek was established in the early 1820's as a settlement for woodcutters by Alexander Berry who eagerly sought the profits that could be had from felling cedar trees in that area.

    <h6 style="color:#608020;">Ulmarra, Clarence River District</h6>
    By 1872, George's son David, had moved to the Clarence River district where he built bridges for the government, but George and Elizabeth remained in Shellharbour until 1873. David was soon accompanied by his brother, Frederick. At first, the work done by the Messrs Rankin was partially tendered out for supplies of logs, hewn timber and earthwork but eventually those too became part of their stock and trade.<br>
    Around 1873, their parents, George and Elizabeth also took on the 700km northwards move, settling in Ulmarra, a small town on the south bank of the Clarence River, lying about 12km north-west of Grafton. There, George also went into bridge building work for the government.

    <h6 style="color:#608020;">Grafton, Clarence River District</h6>
    There are a number of references in the newspapers to Frederick having been settled in Grafton. At the time of his move away from the area, his farm at Great Marlow was put on the market to be sold or let in 1883, just two years before Grafton became a city.

    <h6 style="color:#608020;">Wardell, Richmond River District</h6>
    In 1879, David had his 50 acre property, house and contents at Ulmarra up for sale. He then moved to Wardell and once again was building bridges as well as wharves. It seems that Frederick remained in Grafton until at least 1886 at which time his farm was also up for sale. The exact whereabouts of George and Elizabeth at that time, remain a little unclear.

    <h6 style="color:#608020;">Bexhill, Richmond River District</h6>
    In 1894, only four years before his death, George acquired conditional purchase lands at Bexhill, presumably alongside where David had already settled, having had such warm responses from the locals after very successfully building excellent bridges for them. When David lost his wife in 1898, Elizabeth moved in with him and his six children to care for them as their housekeeper.

    </div>

    <h6 style="color:#608020;">Lismore, Richmond River District</h6>
    David and Frederick went into voluntary insolvency in 1880 and at that time David moved to Lismore. Only two decades earlier, in 1856, the site of William Wilson's homestead paddock was proclaimed to be the "Town of Lismore" in the NSW Government Gazette. In the following years a township grew up on what was once known as the North Arm of the Richmond River, now called Wilsons River.

    <h6 style="color:#608020;">Charcoal / Unanderra, Illawarra District</h6>
    Mention should also be made that Frederick returned south to the Illawarra District, this time to Unanderra about 10km south-west of Wollongong. Unanderra was previously named Charcoal by Alexander Berry, who also called his aboriginal aide by that name, but whose real name was Nunberri. Charcoal was where Frederick's wife Sarah Ann was born. Their move was possibly due to the couple having been married in the neighbouring Dapto and that they simply wanted to be closer to her family.

    <h6 style="color:#608020;">Tweed Heads, Tweed River District</h6>
    Isabella, the daughter of George and Elizabeth, married William Henry Powell of London, and the couple moved to Tweed Heads about 1883.

    <h6 style="color:#608020;">Wyrallah, Richmond River District</h6>
    George and Elizabeth's daughter Rosa Jane married Alexander Thorburn of Wyrallah, on the east bank of Wilsons River, and about 10km south of Lismore. Coincidentally, Wyrallah borders on the north side of the Tucki Tucki Swamp where another member of our family, John Gillies McDonald, had his property named "Hillside". In 1870, Alexander Thorburn first arrived in the Richmond District in search of gold but in 1874 took up working for David Rankin on the Emigrant Creek bridge. Rosa and Alexander later lived in Wollongbar until their retirement in 1919, and celebrated their Golden Wedding anniversary in South Lismore in 1931.

	<h4><b>George, the hard-working, choleric and irascible 'bad egg',<br>
	and Elizabeth, the long suffering wife.
	</b></h4>
    <br>
	From Elizabeth's obituary, 1900:<br>
	1844, at Jamberoo, Shellharbor and Illawarra for some years, then in the Clarence district, for a number of years, <br>
	and finally in Richmond River district, till her death in 1900, leaving behind 3 daughters and 2 sons, incl. Mr. F. Rankin of Unanderra<br>
	and 39 grandchildren on Richmond River, Tweed River and South Coast<br>
	<br>

    With George having been born into such a disease-ridden place that Dundee was at the time, as well as growing up at the height of cholera there, it is not too surprising his temperament became so 'choleric', a term not only referring to 'chole', one of the four bodily humours but also to the behaviour of a person struck by the disease:
    <br>
    <div style="padding-left: 20px;">
    <ul>
    <li>characterized by anger "a choleric outburst","an irascible response"</li>
    <li>quickly aroused to anger "a hotheaded commander"</li>

    <li>"men of the choleric type take to kicking and smashing"- H.G.Wells"</li>

<h2 class="subtitle">About <span>Us</span></h2>
<p><strong>We are the descendants</strong> of Anglo-Scottish-Prusso-Germanic
Australian migrants who settled in the newly formed colonies of New South Wales and Queensland
in the nineteenth century. The idea behind these pages is to present
the stories and characters of those early settlers along with information about their origins, descendants, families, whereabouts and activities.<br><br>

There are often themes running through their struggles and
achievements telling a tale of resourcefulness and hardships in an alien world.
The paradox of Australia as an ancient and raw continent and as a 'New World' portrays
a collision of ideals and realities yet still shows a continuity in how they dealt with everyday life.
