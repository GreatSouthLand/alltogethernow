    <h2><b>The Rankins</b></h2>
    variously spelt: Rankin, Rankine, Ranking, Rangking, Ramkin, Renkin, Renken, Reynkyn, Rankyne, Rankyn, Rainken, Rankeane, Rankan, Ranken
    <br><br>
    
    <h5>From Old Dundee to New South Wales</h5>
    
    Our Australian branch of the Rankin family all started with George Rankin, a carpenter from Dundee. George married Elizabeth Pennycook Murray in 1839 and the couple migrated to New South Wales in 1844 on board the 'Herald' from Greenock.
    <br><br>
    The story of the Rankins reaches back further, though. George was born in Dundee on July 13, 1815 as the only son of David Rankin (1788-1831) and Hellen Thom (or Thoms) (born 1787) who were married in Dundee three years earlier on March 16, 1812. On the monument they erected to remember Hellen, their first child, David Rankin was recorded as being a Wright, in Dundee. "The term 'Wright' comes from the circa 700 AD Old English word 'wryhta' or 'wyrhta', meaning worker or shaper of wood. 'Wright' is still used in Scottish English in the original meaning of 'skilled woodworker'. Wright is also an anglicised version of the Scots Gaelic clan name 'MacIntyre' or 'Mac an t-Saoir'." (source: Wikipedia)
    <br><br>
    George's wife Elizabeth, also a native of Dundee, was born on September 24, 1815 as the eldest child of Frederick Murray and Isabella Baden (or Badden). Frederick is mentioned a number of times as being a linen weaver in Dundee. Weaving was a thriving industry for centuries in Dundee, having its greatest successes with wool, then flax for linen and after that jute which lasted until the end of the 20th century.

    <h5>The Howff</h5>
    
    The Howff is an old burial ground in Dundee which dates back to at least 1564, when Mary, Queen of Scots granted the land which once belonged to the Greyfriar Monks, to the Burgh of Dundee. 'Howff' is a word in the Scots language likely derived from the German word 'Hof' meaning courtyard or enclosed space. Members of the Incorporated Trades of Dundee had used the Howff as a meeting place until 1776. The last burial in the Old Howff took place in 1878.
    <br><br>
    To fully comprehend the presence of the Rankin family in Dundee, it is necessary to build a proper picture of Dundee itself and the Rankins who lived and died there. It was not only George who disappeared from there. Many family members of his family died well before he left for Australia. The records of most interest are connected to the Howff Burying Grounds. The Old Howff is now preserved as part of Scottish National Heritage. The New Howff was opened in 1834, having been modelled on the Glasgow Necropolis. It was eventually carved up and destroyed by the construction of roads, car parks and railways. Very little of it remains.
    <br><br>
    About 80,000 people are recorded as having been buried there since the 1770's, when records started to be made. Before that time, there would have been many more. Yet, there are only between 1000 and 2000 stone monuments, so to have a gravestone at all is distinctly a statement of wealth.

    <h4><b>The Rankins and The Murrays <br> and Boy (George) meets Girl (Elizabeth)</b></h4>
    <br>
    
    The earliest traceable Rankin (or Rankan) ancestor in our line, was our 5x great-grandfather, John Rankan, whose wife was Helen Dick. Their eldest son, David Rankan, was born in Barry, about 9km east of Dundee. David's wife, Ann Salmond, was born in Carmyllie, about 7km north-east of Barry. David and Ann's son, who was also called David, was born in Monikie, and as can be seen from the map to the right, is a place roughly halfway between the birthplaces of his parents.
    <br><br>
    The Salmond family line can be traced back further, all the way to Thomas Salmond, 9x great-grandfather, who was born in 1628. For seven generations the descendants kept close to Carmyllie, venturing sometimes to marry someone from the neighbouring Dunnichen or Monikie. As time progressed, the pull towards Dundee was too great.
    <br><br>
    The same phenomenon happened to Elizabeth Pennycook Murray's ancestors. There was a gradual progression from Perthshire towards Dundee with its booming weaving industry. Dundee is where both George and Elizabeth were born. Yet only a few years after having met in their early twenties, it seems that George, the son of a Wright and Elizabeth, the daughter of a Weaver, somehow became restless enough to go further abroad, to Australia.
    <br><br>
    There are some major factors to consider though. In 1826, when George was about 11 years old, cholera broke out in Dundee and the council acquired a tenement building, originally meant to house sailors, and remodelled it into a Cholera Hospital to isolate the infection. The cholera subsided but in 1831/32 came back with a vengeance. The town's newspaper recorded some time afterwards that one doctor anonymously reported that in 1832 over 5000 people died from the disease in under 6 months.
    <br><br>
    The official records of deaths at that time show only a fraction of that number but it is known there were cholera pits in the Howff cemetery because there was not enough time for proper burials. How many of the Rankins and their relatives succumbed to the disease will probably never be known. George's father died in 1831 of a 'bowel complaint' which could have been cholera related. As well as that, George's two elder siblings are known to have died in infancy, yet it's possible that all his other siblings were also lost to some sickness or another. Elizabeth's parents were both no longer living by 1944 even though they would have only been in their fifties by then.

    <p>1839 December 16 - Marriage of George Rankin, carpenter, and Elizabeth Murray, daughter of Fred. Murray</p>
    </div>
    
    When George and Elizabeth arrived in Australia, they were first located at Shoalhaven, 200km south of Sydney. A few months after they arrived, two more of our ancestors, Thomas and Harriet Fenwick, also turned up in Shoalhaven. George and Elizabeth's daughter, Hellen, eventually married Robert Fenwick, the son of Thomas and Harriet, and Hellen and Robert became our great-grandparents. When Thomas and Harriet relocated to Wollongong, 100km north of Shoalhaven, George and Elizabeth did too. Again when Thomas and Harriet moved a bit further south to Shellharbour, George and Elizabeth were there as well. George set up business as a contractor, first repairing and rebuilding, then taking on large projects such as building bridges and wharves with his sons, David and Frederick. Many of the contracts went through the Shellharbour Council where Thomas was three times Mayor.
    <br><br>
    George's son David Rankin landed a bridge building contract further north in Uralla and George and family followed, and so did Thomas's eldest son Robert Fenwick and his wife Hellen. From there they all stuck together as they moved their way further northwards till they reached the Northern Rivers district, close to where another of our ancestors, Duncan McIntyre, was settled at Wardell. David and George settled at Bexhill, alongside Corndale where Duncan's daughter, our great-grandmother Jessie (McIntyre) McDonald, lived the rest of her days, till she passed away in 1916. Duncan McIntyre's father-in-law, Joseph Kelly, was also buried in the Dundee Howff where many of the Rankin family members came to their final rest.

<h2 class="subtitle">About <span>Us</span></h2>
<p><strong>We are the descendants</strong> of Anglo-Scottish-Prusso-Germanic
Australian migrants who settled in the newly formed colonies of New South Wales and Queensland
in the nineteenth century. The idea behind these pages is to present
the stories and characters of those early settlers along with information about their origins, descendants, families, whereabouts and activities.<br><br>

There are often themes running through their struggles and
achievements telling a tale of resourcefulness and hardships in an alien world.
The paradox of Australia as an ancient and raw continent and as a 'New World' portrays
a collision of ideals and realities yet still shows a continuity in how they dealt with everyday life.
