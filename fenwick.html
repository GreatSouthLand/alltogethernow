    <h2><b>The Fenwicks</b></h2>
    <div class="article-info box"></div>
    variously spelt Fenwyke, Fenwicke, Fennick or Fenwick


    <br><br>
    <h5>From the Fens of the North</h5>

    The Fenwicks are said to have descended from Saxons who made their home in the fens of the ancient kingdom of Northumbria. The fens lay in lands which sprawled across both England and Scotland, known closer to the border as 'The Marches', from an old Frankish word for border territory.

    Needless to say, the Scots on one side and the English on the other, were sworn enemies.

    <p><i>Reivers raid on Gilnockie Tower</i>
    <br>from an original drawing by G. Cattermole</p>
    </div>

    Countless attacks, often very brutal, accompanied by desperate raids and rampaging destruction led to the Marches on both sides of the border gaining a reputation as being treacherous and lawless places.
    <br>
    <h5>Border Reivers, the Stuff of Nightmares</h5>

    In order to counteract the escalating unrest, Scotland and England appointed wardens as overlords. These wardens in turn appointed sheriffs and the Fenwicks filled these offices with great ardour.
    The perpetrators of the plundering were dubbed 'Border Reivers' by Sir Walter Scott in his <i>Minstrelsy of the Scottish Border</i> in an attempt to idealise these lawless clans of evil-doers.
    <br>
    <h5>The Border Papers</h5>
    As unusual as it was for the time, records were nonetheless kept of every skirmish, battle, raid, theft, murder, vengeful attack and so on. The majority of these records occurred as letters passing between powerful people. Eventually the letters were bound together into a few volumes called The Border Papers. The Fenwicks and their activity in the marches are therefore rather well documented and make for a good read. From going over their personal correspondence as well as looking at other people's comments about them, it can be seen that they were not only very forthright by nature and indignant over the situation, they were also not spared from being the victims of savage attacks.

    In another letter we find that the guilty parties were not short of retaliatory threats in the face of justice either.

    <u>The Bishop of Durham, to Huntingdon</u> &nbsp; &nbsp; <u>Letter dated 1595. Aug. 7.</u><br>

    "Whereof a great prezumpcion at the bar this presente Assizes, was publiqely shewen by one David Armstrong alias Bangtaill, a Scot, and a notorious owtlaw, who being apprehended and brought in by Mr William Fenwick of Wallington upon your lordshipes commandement, arrained and found guiltie of eight severall felonies, feared not to threaten Mr Fenwick, that though he were the best beloved gentleman of his clan, yet his heeles should be lifted and turned up to the sky for bringing him, being a Scot, to be tried here before us!"

    <br>
    <br>
    <h5>The Raid of the Redeswire</h5>
    The pure innocence of the Fenwicks is a little obscure though. The Border Reivers had a second calling after their dastardly deeds - they had an obsession over poetry and ballad writing. In one particular ballad, 'The Raid of the Redeswire' which recalls a border skirmish which occurred on the 7th of July 1675, the Fenwicks, having been summoned by the March Warden, are given a mention:
    <br><br>
    </td></tr></table>


    <div class="row">
    <div class="col33">

    And warlike weapons at their will<br>
    </i>
    </div>
    <div class="col60">
    It's possible that these lines are simply a poetic reference to the sheer number of
    Fenwicks all over the Marches, but in other accounts, the clan incited fear in many a foe,
    marching forth with yells and shouts of: <br><br>
    <i>A Fenwyke!, &nbsp; &nbsp;A Fenwyke!, &nbsp; &nbsp;A Fenwyke!</i>
    </div>
    </div>
    <br>


    <h5>The Illustrious and Distinguished Fenwicks</h5>
    James Clephan in his article in <i>North Country Lore and Legend Volume III</i> said of the Fenwicks:
    <div class="geni">
    They had their tower of strength in the time of Henry III, and till England passed under the sway of Henry IV, when Sir John de Fenwyke acquired Wallington by marriage with Mary, daughter of William del Strother. The older seas of the Fenwicks was then suffered to fall into decay; the stronghold became a farm house; the tower - Fenwick Tower - was pulled down in 1775
    </div>
    Richard Melford in his late 1800's articles <i>Men of Mark 'Twixt Tyne and Tweed'</i> describes the Fenwicks as 'Fierce and resolute in their own character and disposition' and goes on to speak rather glowingly about descendants of the clan. In one part he says:
    <div class="geni">
    Northumbrian history teems with them. They were established at Brinkburn and Bywell, Earsdon and Eachwick, Heddon and Kenton, Meldon and Matfen, Newcastle and Offerton, Stanton and Stamfordham, and so on, right down the alphabet of local topography to Whitton and Wallington. At one time or another members of this widely diffused family have filled every position of trust and of honour in the Northern Counties that sovereign could bestow, burgess award, or professional acquirement achieve.

    <br>

    Yet in another place he adds:
    <div class="geni">
    Several members of the race of Fenwick have become at various times citizens of Newcastle; a few of them have achieved distinction in the public life of the town, Nicholas Fenwick, to whom Ambrose Barnes surrendered his alderman's gown, and Vicar March dedicated his sermon, "The False Prophet Unmasked" filled the office of Sheriff in the municipal year 1678-79, and was Mayor in 1682-83 and 1697-98.
    <br><br>
    Robert Fenwick became Mayor in 1708. Nicholas Fenwick obtained the shrievalty in 1713, and was five times Mayor - 1720-21, 1726-27, 1736-37, 1746-47, and 1747-48. He contested the borough as Parliamentary candidate on three successive occasions (1727, 1734, and 1741), and in each instance was successful.

    <h5>Thomas the Fenwick</h5>
    The list goes on, but it does become rather interesting when considering our bloodline which migrated to Australia. Thomas Fenwick, the earliest of our Fenwick ancestors to have set foot in The Great South Land, hailed from Hull on the southern border of what was once Northumbria, the stomping ground of the Fenwicks of old. In the spirit of his forebears, Thomas was was not only an alderman but three times Mayor of Shellharbour.
    <br>

    <h5>Saxons in the Family</h5>
    Of curious interest to our family's history are the lands of the original Saxons. They lie at the lower end of the Jutland peninsula, the northern end of which is now Denmark. Note the 'mark' in Denmark has the same origin as the 'marches' of the Fenwick lands. In the late Roman empire the term Saxon was used to denote the Germanic coastal raiders and used in the same sense as Viking is used today. The Saxons undoubtedly maintained their raiding habits in Northumbria as the basis of their Reiver activity. The original homeland of the Saxons changed names over time and eventually became Holstein, the place where another branch of the family, the Süchtings had their roots before migrating to Australia.

    <h2><b>The Fenwicks in Australia</b></h2>
    <br>
    The Australian Fenwicks of the family started with our great-great-grandparents, Thomas and Harriet Fenwick, who migrated from Hull in 1844.

    <h5>From Kingston upon Hull and Drypool</h5>

    Now better known as 'Hull', Kingston upon Hull was originally an outlying part of the hamlet of Myton, named Wyke, probably derived from the Saxon word Wic meaning dwelling place or refuge. It has been told that in the 13th century, King Edward I and his hunting party followed a hare which "led them along the delightful banks of the River Hull to the hamlet of Wyke and charmed with the scene before him, viewed with delight the advantageous situation of this hitherto neglected and obscure corner. He foresaw it might become subservient both to render the kingdom more secure against foreign invasion, and at the same time greatly to enforce its commerce" (source: J.C.Craggs, Guide to Hull, 1817). Consequently, on the 1st of April, 1299, King Edward granted it a royal charter that renamed the settlement King's town upon Hull. It's interesting to note that the 'Wyke' part was still present in the earlier spelling of the name of Fenwyke.

    </div>

    <br><br>
    Yet to be more precise, according to the marriage record of Thomas and Harriet, both of them were living at No. 6 Naylor's Row in Drypool, which was originally a small hamlet on the other side of the river Hull from the main township. Drypool was first mentioned in the Domesday Book as Dridpole, owned by Drogo de Bevrere, and was notoriously prone to flooding. After having been raised and drained, it became farmland and consisted of the Drypool Chapel and a few houses. In the 1680s, a citadel was built on the south side and used as a garrison until 1849. The population of Drypool in 1821 had reached 1,409 and in 1837 the hamlet and its parish were both absorbed into Kingston upon Hull. From 1837 to 1898, Drypool was part of the registration district of Sculcoates which, in 1937, was itself absorbed into Hull and Holderness districts.

    <h4>Assisted Passage to Australia</h4>
    <br>

    Three years after they were married, Thomas and Harriet migrated to Australia. They left Detport in London on March 1, 1844 and arrived in Port Jackson on June 20 the next year. The records of the ship on which they travelled, the Royal Saxon, reveal that they left London with 'Bounty' assisted passage and an agreement to employ them at the other end, namely at Captain Addison's Peterborough Estate in Illawarra. Thomas was to be employed as a Blacksmith, and 'otherwise make himself generally useful as a farm servant' for the term of 12 calendar months.

    <div class="lbox" style="width:40%; margin:20px 20px 10px 0px;">

    <p>The Peterborough Estate partitioned into five parts marked A to E, which were allocated to the five inheritors who drew lots to determine ownership. <br>
    <br>
    The circled area indicates the location of the Lake House from where Thomas was managing the estate for Captain Addison.
    <br><br>
    The small cross-hatched area on the coast was first known as Peterborough Village and then Shellharbour Township. The whole of the area later became known as Shellharbour. <br>
    <br>
    (Click on picture to see a larger version.)</p>
    </div>

    Captain Addison in return agreed to pay him a yearly salary of 16 pounds sterling as well as to supply him with weekly rations of 12 pounds of beef or mutton, 20 pounds of flour, 3 pounds of sugar and 4 ounces of tea.

    At the time of her marriage, Harriet had no occupation but for the assisted passage on the Royal Saxon's records she is recorded as a House Servant. Only Thomas was employed at Captain Addison's Estate and not Harriet. Hopefully she knew what to do with all that mutton, beef, flour and tea, every week.


    <h5>The Wentworths and Peterborough Estate</h5>

    The lives of Thomas and Harriet Fenwick were not only tied to the fortunes of Peterborough Estate but also directly and indirectly to the family members who inherited it, the Wentworths.The 13,050 acre estate was itself part of over 34,000 acres accrued by the self-styled wealthy and colorful colonial figure, D'Arcy Wentworth, the largest land owner in the Colony of New South Wales at the time of his death. Among other things, he was also Principal Surgeon, Chief Magistrate, Superintendant of Police and Co-founder of the Bank of New South Wales.

    <br><br>
    D'Arcy was the husband of the famous author, Jane Austin, who remained married to him, even though he had a total of twelve children to two other women.

    His eldest children, William, Dorset (called D'Arcy), Matthew (called John) and Martha, were born to Catherine Crowley, a convict who died in 1800.

    The rest of the children, George, Martha, Sophia, Robert, John, Mary-Ann, Katherine and Charles, were all born to Ann Lawes who was actually still the wife of James McNeal, whom she married when she was fifteen.

    Upon his death on July 5, 1827, all of D'Arcy Wentworth's properties were bound up in a rather obscure manner and held in trust to the benefit of his seven children who survived him.

    The part of that inheritance which is relevant here is the Peterborough Estate, which was left to five of the children as tenants in common, meaning that they couldn't inherit from one another.<br>
    <br>

    Those five children were:
    <div class="display-table noline" style="width:100%; margin:6px 0px 0px 0px; padding:0px;">

    <div><div>Robert</div><div> who ran into so much debt that his shares were eventually acquired by his brothers-in-law, Towns and Addision.</div></div>

    <div><div>Martha</div><div> who married John Reddall whose son, Thomas Reddall, was a member of the Shellharbour Council alongside Thomas Fenwick.</div></div>

    <div><div>Sophia</div><div> who married Robert Towns, the owner of the Royal Saxon which took Thomas and Harriet to New South Wales. Also on board were Robert's wife Sophia Wentworth and her sister Katherine Wentworth. Robert Towns is honored by having Townsville named after him.</div></div>

    <div><div>Mary&#8209;Ann</div><div> who first married Stephen Addison, for whom Thomas was estate manager for 9 years. Mary-Ann later married Charles Hollings.</div></div>

    <div><div>Katherine</div><div> who first married Benjamin Darley, a business associate of Robert Towns. She later married William Bassett. Those two surnames appear on the Shellharbour Bassett-Darley Estate where Thomas and Harriet spent the last 20 or so years of their conjugal bliss. The government passed a special Private Act of Parliament, the Bassett-Darley Estates Act in 1877, to enable Katherine to unlock the conditions of her inheritance and sell the lands during her lifetime.</div></div>

    <h5>Peterborough, Wollongong and Shellharbour</h5>

    It must have worked out well for the couple on the Peterborough Estate. In the obituary for Harriet published in The Illawarra Mercury, 23 October 1894, it was stated that Thomas had been the manager of Captain Addison's estate for nine years. He conducted all the estate's business, including buying and selling, from the 'Lake House' homestead (shown circled in map above) until such time that the estate passed from Captain Addison. Thomas and Harriet then moved 10 miles north to Wollongong. That would have been about 1853 but after a few years they returned to Shellharbour, as it was then known.
    <br><br>
    For five years or so, Thomas ran a business in Wollongong with another tradesman, the Wheelwright, Octavius Pollard. Until 1858, the business traded as Fenwick and Pollard, Blacksmiths and Wheelwrights, and was situated in Crown Street, Wollongong. The premises, which included its own dwelling-house, were eventually taken over in 1859 and run by William Ahern and Thomas Allen, formerly of Howitt and Sons.

    Back in Shellharbour, Thomas took up farming as well as being a council alderman for 25 years, during which time he was elected as mayor no less than three times. He also upheld the law as a magistrate, a Justice of the Peace, or J.P. for short.

    The farm at Stoney Range, which Thomas held for 27 years up until his death, was part of what was known as the Bassett-Darley Estate of Shellharbour. As mentioned earlier, it was one of many estates inherited, in part, by Captain Addison's wife Mary-Ann Wentworth and four of her siblings.

<h2 class="subtitle">About <span>Us</span></h2>
<strong>We are the descendants</strong> of Anglo-Scottish-Prusso-Germanic
Australian migrants who settled in the newly formed colonies of New South Wales and Queensland
in the nineteenth century. The idea behind these pages is to present
the stories and characters of those early settlers along with information about their origins, descendants, families, whereabouts and activities.
<br><br>
There are often themes running through their struggles and
achievements telling a tale of resourcefulness and hardships in an alien world.
The paradox of Australia as an ancient and raw continent and as a 'New World' portrays
a collision of ideals and realities yet still shows a continuity in how those people dealt with everyday life.
