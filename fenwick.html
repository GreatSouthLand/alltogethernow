    <h2><b>The Fenwicks</b></h2>
    <div class="article-info box"></div>
    variously spelt Fenwyke, Fenwicke, Fennick or Fenwick


    <br><br>
    <h5>From the Fens of the North</h5>

    The Fenwicks are said to have descended from Saxons who made their home in the fens of the ancient kingdom Northumbria. The fens lay in lands which sprawled across both England and Scotland, known closer to the border as 'The Marches', from an old Frankish word for border territory.

    Needless to say, the Scots on one side and the English on the other, were sworn enemies.

    <p><i>Reivers raid on Gilnockie Tower</i>
    <br>from an original drawing by G. Cattermole</p>
    </div>

    Countless attacks, often very brutal, accompanied by desperate raids and rampaging destruction led to the Marches on both sides of the border gaining a reputation as being treacherous and lawless places.<!--, the terra incognita.-->
    <br>
    <h5>Border Reivers, the Stuff of Nightmares</h5>

    In order to counteract the escalating unrest, Scotland and England appointed wardens as overlords. These wardens in turn appointed sheriffs and the Fenwicks filled these offices with great ardour.
    The perpetrators of the plundering were dubbed 'Border Reivers' by Sir Walter Scott in his <i>Minstrelsy of the Scottish Border</i> in an attempt to idealise these lawless clans of evil-doers.
    <br>
    <h5>The Border Papers</h5>
    As unusual as it was for the time, records were nonetheless kept of every skirmish, battle, raid, theft, murder, vengeful attack and so on. The majority of these records occurred as letters passing between powerful people. Eventually the letters were bound together into a few volumes called the Border Papers. The Fenwicks and their activity in the marches are therefore rather well documented and make for a good read. From going over their personal correspondence as well as looking at other people's comments about them, it can be seen that they were not only very forthright by nature and indignant over the situation, they were also not spared from being the victims of savage attacks.

    <u>Fenwick to [Huntingdon]</u> &nbsp; &nbsp; <u>Letter dated 1593. Oct. 14.</u><br>
    I have been greatly hindered sending the certificate, as the Scots on the last day of September came into Tynedale and "reft" 60 oxen and kie and 60 sheep, besides insight goods and slew one John Yarrowe my own houshold servant. And further on Saturday the sixthe of this instant October, dyverse of the same Scottes to the nomber of two thowsand men, or thereaboutes, have about IX of the clock, in the forenoone of the same daie, runne a forrowe within England, and have taken and driven away out of Tyndall where I have chardge, aboute nyne hundreth threscore and five kie and oxen, and about a thowsand sheepe and goates, besides insight, burning an onsett and a mill, of which I doubt not your lordship hath already heard. Hoping for relief and protection for the poor subjects, and myself and other poor gentlemen hereabouts who have no other refuge or support, but by your honour's means. Wallington."<br>
    1 p. Written by Huntingdon's clerk. Indorsed :  Received from Mr Fenwick of Wallington.

    In another letter we find that the guilty parties were not short of retaliatory threats in the face of justice either.

    <h5>The Raid of the Redeswire</h5>
    The pure innocence of the Fenwicks is a little obscure though. The Border Reivers had a second calling after their dastardly deeds - they had an obsession over poetry and ballad writing. In one particular ballad, 'The Raid of the Redeswire' which recalls a border skirmish which occurred on the 7th of July 1675, the Fenwicks, having been summoned by the March Warden, are given a mention:

    <h5>The Illustrious and Distinguished Fenwicks</h5>
    James Clephan in his article in <i>North Country Lore and Legend Volume III</i> said of the Fenwicks:
    <div class="geni">
    They had their tower of strength in the time of Henry III, and till England passed under the sway of Henry IV, when Sir John de Fenwyke acquired Wallington by marriage with Mary, daughter of William del Strother. The older seas of the Fenwicks was then suffered to fall into decay; the stronghold became a farm house; the tower - Fenwick Tower - was pulled down in 1775
    </div>
    Richard Melford in his late 1800's articles <i>Men of Mark 'Twixt Tyne and Tweed'</i> describes the Fenwicks as 'Fierce and resolute in their own character and disposition' and goes on to speak rather glowingly about descendants of the clan. In one part he says:
    <div class="geni">
    Northumbrian history teems with them. They were established at Brinkburn and Bywell, Earsdon and Eachwick, Heddon and Kenton, Meldon and Matfen, Newcastle and Offerton, Stanton and Stamfordham, and so on, right down the alphabet of local topography to Whitton and Wallington. At one time or another members of this widely diffused family have filled every position of trust and of honour in the Northern Counties that sovereign could bestow, burgess award, or professional acquirement achieve.

    </div>
    <br>

    Yet in another place he adds:
    <div class="geni">
    Several members of the race of Fenwick have become at various times citizens of Newcastle; a few of them have achieved distinction in the public life of the town, Nicholas Fenwick, to whom Ambrose Barnes surrendered his alderman's gown, and Vicar March dedicated his sermon, "The False Prophet Unmasked" filled the office of Sheriff in the municipal year 1678-79, and was Mayor in 1682-83 and 1697-98.
    <br><br>
    Robert Fenwick became Mayor in 1708. Nicholas Fenwick obtained the shrievalty in 1713, and was five times Mayor - 1720-21, 1726-27, 1736-37, 1746-47, and 1747-48. He contested the borough as Parliamentary candidate on three successive occasions (1727, 1734, and 1741), and in each instance was successful.

    <h5>Thomas the Fenwick</h5>
    The list goes on, but it does become rather interesting when considering our bloodline which migrated to Australia. Thomas Fenwick, the earliest of our Fenwick ancestors to have set foot in The Great South Land, hailed from Hull on the southern border of what was once Northumbria, the stomping ground of the Fenwicks of old. In the spirit of his forebears, Thomas was was not only an alderman but three times Mayor of Shellharbour.

    <h5>Saxons in the Family</h5>
    Of curious interest to our family's history are the lands of the original Saxons. They lie at the lower end of the Jutland peninsula, the northern end of which is now Denmark. Note the 'mark' in Denmark has the same origin as the 'marches' of the Fenwick lands. In the late Roman empire the term Saxon was used to denote the Germanic coastal raiders and used in the same sense as Viking is used today. The Saxons undoubtedly maintained their raiding habits in Northumbria as the basis of their Reiver activity. The original homeland of the Saxons changed names over time and eventually became Holstein, the place where another branch of the family, the Süchtings had their roots before migrating to Australia.<br>

<strong>We are the descendants</strong> of Anglo-Scottish-Prusso-Germanic
Australian migrants who settled in the newly formed colonies of New South Wales and Queensland
in the nineteenth century. The idea behind these pages is to present
the stories and characters of those early settlers along with information about their origins, descendants, families, whereabouts and activities.
<br><br>
There are often themes running through their struggles and
achievements telling a tale of resourcefulness and hardships in an alien world.
The paradox of Australia as an ancient and raw continent and as a 'New World' portrays
a collision of ideals and realities yet still shows a continuity in how those people dealt with everyday life.
