    <p>1839 December 16 - Marriage of George Rankin, carpenter, and Elizabeth Murray, daughter of Fred. Murray</p>
    </div>
    
    When George and Elizabeth arrived in Australia early in 1844, they first relocated to Shellharbour, 70 miles south of Sydney. A few months after their arrival, two more of our ancestors, Thomas and Harriet Fenwick, also turned up in Shellharbour. Their son, Robert Fenwick ended up marrying George and Elizabeth's daughter, Hellen Rankin. Hellen and Robert became our great-grandparents.

    <!--
    George and Elizabeth's daughter, Hellen, eventually married Robert Fenwick, the son of Thomas and Harriet, and Hellen and Robert became our great-grandparents. 
    -->
    When Thomas and Harriet moved to Wollongong, 17 miles north of Shellharbour, George and Elizabeth did too. Again when Thomas and Harriet returned to Shellharbour, George and Elizabeth were there as well. George set up business as a contractor, first repairing and rebuilding, then taking on large projects such as building bridges and wharves with his sons, David and Frederick under the business name of George Rankin and Sons. Many of the contracts went through the Shellharbour Council where Thomas was three times Mayor.
    <br><br>
    Around 1872, George's son David managed to get his first bridge building contract further north in the Clarence River district. George and family followed, and so did Thomas's eldest son, Robert Fenwick with his wife Hellen. From there they all stuck together as they moved their way further northwards until reaching the Richmond River district, close to where another of our ancestors, Duncan McIntyre, was settled at Wardell.  At least one of David Rankin's children, Ernest Charles David, was born in Wardell. Later, David and George settled at Bexhill, alongside Corndale where Duncan McIntyre's daughter, our great-grandmother Jessie (McIntyre) McDonald, lived out the rest of her days, till she passed away in 1916. As a matter of further conincidence, Duncan McIntyre's father-in-law, Joseph Kelly, was buried in the Dundee Howff where many of the Rankin family members came to their final rest.

    <h4><b>George Rankin, the choleric</b></h4>
    <br>
    
    With George having been born into such a disease-ridden place as Dundee was at the time and growing up at the height of cholera, it is not too surprising his temperament became so 'choleric', a term not only referring to 'chole', one of the four bodily humours but also to the behaviour of a person struck by the disease: 
    <br>

    </div>
   
    </div>



    
    <h6 style="color:#608020;">Jamberoo, Illawarra District</h6>
    The first place where George and Elizabeth lived in Australia was Jamberoo, a settlement which grew up around the cedar cutting of the early nineteenth century. The village of Jamberoo lies at the western end of the Minnamurra Swamp and is nestled in the steep sided valley of the Minnamurra River. As such, it is not subjected to the extreme weather which happens, for instance, in the nearby Albion Park.
    
    <h6 style="color:#608020;">Ulmarra, Clarence River District</h6>
    By 1872, George's son David, had moved to the Clarence River district where he built bridges for the government, but George and Elizabeth remained in Shellharbour until 1873. David was soon accompanied by his brother, Frederick. At first, the work done by the Messrs Rankin was partially tendered out for supplies of logs, hewn timber and earthwork but eventually those too became part of their stock and trade.<br>
    Around 1873, their parents, George and Elizabeth also took on the 700km northwards move, settling in Ulmarra, a small town on the south bank of the Clarence River, lying about 12km north-west of Grafton. There, George also went into bridge building work for the government.
    
    <h6 style="color:#608020;">Grafton, Clarence River District</h6>
    There are a number of references in the newspapers to Frederick having been settled in Grafton. At the time of his move away from the area, his farm at Great Marlow was put on the market to be sold or let in 1883, just two years before Grafton became a city.
    
    <h6 style="color:#608020;">Wardell, Richmond River District</h6>
    In 1879, David had his 50 acre property, house and contents at Ulmarra up for sale. He then moved to Wardell and once again was building bridges as well as wharves. It seems that Frederick remained in Grafton until at least 1886 at which time his farm was also up for sale. The exact whereabouts of George and Elizabeth at that time, remain a little unclear.
    
    <h6 style="color:#608020;">Bexhill, Richmond River District</h6>
    In 1894, only four years before his death, George acquired conditional purchase lands at Bexhill, presumably alongside where David had already settled, having had such warm responses from the locals after very successfully building excellent bridges for them. When David lost his wife in 1898, Elizabeth moved in with him and his six children to care for them as their housekeeper.

	</p>
    </div>

    <h6 style="color:#608020;">Lismore, Richmond River District</h6>
    David and Frederick went into voluntary insolvency in 1880 and at that time David moved to Lismore. Only two decades earlier, in 1856, the site of William Wilson's homestead paddock was proclaimed to be the "Town of Lismore" in the NSW Government Gazette. In the following years a township grew up on what was once known as the North Arm of the Richmond River, now called Wilsons River. 
    
    <h6 style="color:#608020;">Unanderra (Charcoal), Illawarra District</h6>
    Mention should also be made that Frederick returned south to the Illawarra District, this time to Unanderra about 10km south-west of Wollongong. Unanderra was previously known as Charcoal and is where Frederick's wife Sarah Ann was born. The move was possibly due to the couple having been married in the neighbouring Dapto and that they simply wanted to be closer to her family.
    
    <h6 style="color:#608020;">Tweed Heads, Tweed River District</h6>
    Isabella, the daughter of George and Elizabeth, married William Henry Powell of London, and the couple moved to Tweed Heads about 1883. 
    
    <h6 style="color:#608020;">Wyrallah, Richmond River District</h6>
    George and Elizabeth's daughter Rosa Jane married Alexander Thorburn of Wyrallah, on the east bank of Wilsons River, and about 10km south of Lismore. Coincidentally, Wyrallah borders on the north side of the Tucki Tucki Swamp where another member of our family, John Gillies McDonald, had his property named "Hillside". In 1870, Alexander Thorburn first arrived in the Richmond District in search of gold but in 1874 took up working for David Rankin on the Emigrant Creek bridge. Rosa and Alexander later lived in Wollongbar until their retirement in 1919, and celebrated their Golden Wedding anniversary in South Lismore in 1931.

<h2 class="subtitle">About <span>Us</span></h2>
<strong>We are the descendants</strong> of Anglo-Scottish-Prusso-Germanic
Australian migrants who settled in the newly formed colonies of New South Wales and Queensland
in the nineteenth century. The idea behind these pages is to present
the stories and characters of those early settlers along with information about their origins, descendants, families, whereabouts and activities.
<br><br>
There are often themes running through their struggles and
achievements telling a tale of resourcefulness and hardships in an alien world.
The paradox of Australia as an ancient and raw continent and as a 'New World' portrays
a collision of ideals and realities yet still shows a continuity in how those people dealt with everyday life.
