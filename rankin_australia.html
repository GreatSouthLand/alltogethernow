    <p>1839 December 16 - Marriage of George Rankin, carpenter, and Elizabeth Murray, daughter of Fred. Murray</p>
    </div>
    
    When George and Elizabeth arrived in Australia early in 1844, they were first located at Shellharbour, 70 miles south of Sydney. A few months after they arrived, two more of our ancestors, Thomas and Harriet Fenwick, also turned up in Shellharbour. Their son, Robert Fenwick ended up marrying George and Elizabeth's daughter, Hellen Rankin. Hellen and Robert became our great-grandparents. 
    
    <!--
    George and Elizabeth's daughter, Hellen, eventually married Robert Fenwick, the son of Thomas and Harriet, and Hellen and Robert became our great-grandparents. 
    -->
    When Thomas and Harriet relocated to Wollongong, 17 miles north of Shellharbour, George and Elizabeth did too. Again when Thomas and Harriet returned to Shellharbour, as it was then known, George and Elizabeth were there as well. George set up business as a contractor, first repairing and rebuilding, then taking on large projects such as building bridges and wharves with his sons, David and Frederick. Many of the contracts went through the Shellharbour Council where Thomas was three times Mayor.
    <br><br>
    George's son David Rankin managed to get his first bridge building contract further north in the Clarence River district. George and family followed, and so did Thomas's eldest son, Robert Fenwick with his wife Hellen. From there they all stuck together as they moved their way further northwards until reaching the Richmond River district, close to where another of our ancestors, Duncan McIntyre, was settled at Wardell.  At least one of David Rankin's children, Ernest Charles David, was born in Wardell. Later, David and George settled at Bexhill, alongside Corndale where Duncan McIntyre's daughter, our great-grandmother Jessie (McIntyre) McDonald, lived out the rest of her days, till she passed away in 1916. As a matter of further conincidence, Duncan McIntyre's father-in-law, Joseph Kelly, was buried in the Dundee Howff where many of the Rankin family members came to their final rest.

    With George having been born into such a disease-ridden place as Dundee and growing up at the height of cholera, it is not too surprising his temperament became so 'choleric', a term not only referring to 'chole', one of the four bodily humors but also to the behavior of a person struck by the disease:

<h2 class="subtitle">About <span>Us</span></h2>
<strong>We are the descendants</strong> of Anglo-Scottish-Prusso-Germanic
Australian migrants who settled in the newly formed colonies of New South Wales and Queensland
in the nineteenth century. The idea behind these pages is to present
the stories and characters of those early settlers along with information about their origins, descendants, families, whereabouts and activities.
<br><br>
There are often themes running through their struggles and
achievements telling a tale of resourcefulness and hardships in an alien world.
The paradox of Australia as an ancient and raw continent and as a 'New World' portrays
a collision of ideals and realities yet still shows a continuity in how those people dealt with everyday life.
