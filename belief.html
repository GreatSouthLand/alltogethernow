    <p>A watercolor sketch of Brisbane from 1853, around the time of the start of German migration. 
    <br><br>
    The first stop, Brisbane, proved to be a place which was not too welcoming for the early German arrivals who were told to move off into other areas of Queensland, which most did, but some took the next ship home.</p>

    <h2><b>The Beliefs of Our German Forebears</b></h2>

    Telling the tale of our ancestors and their families would be far from complete without a thorough coverage of the religion (literally: that which binds) which held those people together, not only in respect to body and soul but also as family and community.

<i>According to Ernst Stoeffler, 
historian of classical Pietism, 

“It had no one system of theology, 
no one integrating doctrine, no one 
particular type of polity, no one 
liturgy, no geographical homogeneity”.

It placed “emphasis... 
upon inner identification with God”

    (from "The Religious Culture of Queensland" 
     by John Harrison (University of Queensland)

    From the few skericks of artifacts, newspaper articles and family stories which remain, all we do know is that the early settlers were deeply entrenced in their religious practices. Even though it is not possible to obtain complete knowledge of their feelings, devotions and discussions or what they made of their beliefs in their daily life, an attempt will be made just the same. <!--Therefore, in a bold attempt to obtain a broader as well as more detailed view of early religious life, the first avenue of investigation will be to delve into some speculative and deductiive assumptions or suppositions of some more recent historians.-->
    <br><br>
    <!--Before starting, it -->It is important to recognise that the religious practices of the early German settlers in Queensland were rooted in what they had brought with them from the old country. These were gradually tainted and eventiually overtaken by British and American imports of evangelism, some inter-denominational marriages, as well as government regulations on how religion was to be practised. This of course entailed the erection of church buildings and the establishment of recognised and authorised leaders conducting their affairs with a specific code of behaviour. The newcomers embraced this involvement, effectively creating an official and professional clergy, therewith securing their personal income. But the days of the old ways were numbered.

    The Mount Walker German Baptist Church which opened in 1872 acted as the headquarters of the German Baptists until 1879 at which time Engelsburg (later named Kalbar) became more prominent. <br>
    <br>
    The Mount Walker Church of Christ opened in 1884. Located at 10 Hinrichsen Road, just off the Rosewood-Warrill View Road, it still holds Sunday services (2022).<br>

<h2 class="subtitle">About <span>Us</span></h2>
<strong>We are the descendants</strong> of Anglo-Scottish-Prusso-Germanic
Australian migrants who settled in the newly formed colonies of New South Wales and Queensland
in the nineteenth century. The idea behind these pages is to present
the stories and characters of those early settlers along with information about their origins, descendants, families, whereabouts and activities.
<br><br>
There are often themes running through their struggles and
achievements telling a tale of resourcefulness and hardships in an alien world.
The paradox of Australia as an ancient and raw continent and as a 'New World' portrays
a collision of ideals and realities yet still shows a continuity in how those people dealt with everyday life.
