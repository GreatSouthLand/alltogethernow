    The first stop, Brisbane, proved to be a place which was not too welcoming for the early German arrivals who were told to move off into other areas of Queensland, which most did, but some took the next ship home.</p>

    Telling the tale of our ancestors and their families would be far from complete without a thorough coverage of the religion (literally: that which binds) which held those people together, not only in respect to body and soul but also as family and community.

<i>According to Ernst Stoeffler, 
historian of classical Pietism, 

“It had no one system of theology, 
no one integrating doctrine, no one 
particular type of polity, no one 
liturgy, no geographical homogeneity”.

It placed “emphasis... 
upon inner identification with God”

    (from "The Religious Culture of Queensland" 
     by John Harrison (University of Queensland)

    From the few skericks of artifacts, newspaper articles and family stories which remain, all we do know is that the early settlers were deeply entrenced in their religious practices. Even though it is not possible to obtain complete knowledge of their feelings, devotions and discussions or what they made of their beliefs in their daily life, an attempt will be made just the same. <!--Therefore, in a bold attempt to obtain a broader as well as more detailed view of early religious life, the first avenue of investigation will be to delve into some speculative and deductiive assumptions or suppositions of some more recent historians.-->
    <br><br>
    <!--Before starting, it -->It is important to recognise that the religious practices of the early German settlers in Queensland were rooted in what they had brought with them from the old country. These were gradually tainted and eventiually overtaken by British and American imports of evangelism, some inter-denominational marriages, as well as government regulations on how religion was to be practised. This of course entailed the erection of church buildings and the establishment of recognised and authorised leaders conducting their affairs with a specific code of behaviour. The newcomers embraced this involvement, effectively creating an official and professional clergy, therewith securing their personal income. But the days of the old ways were numbered.

belief (n.)

late 12c., bileave, "confidence reposed in a person or thing; 
faith in a religion," replacing Old English geleafa "belief, faith," 
from West Germanic *ga-laubon "to hold dear, esteem, trust" 
(source also of Old Saxon gilobo, Middle Dutch gelove, 
Old High German giloubo, German Glaube), from *galaub- "dear, esteemed," 
from intensive prefix *ga- + PIE root *leubh- "to care, desire, love." 
The prefix in English was altered on analogy of the verb believe. 
The distinction of the final consonant from that of believe developed 15c.

    The be-, which is not a natural prefix of nouns, 
    was prefixed on the analogy of the vb. (where it 
    is naturally an intensive) .... [OED]

The meaning "conviction of the truth of a proposition or alleged fact 
without knowledge" is by 1530s; it is also "sometimes used to include 
the absolute conviction or certainty which accompanies knowledge" 
[Century Dictionary]. 
From c. 1200 as "a creed, essential doctrines of a religion or church, 
things held to be true as a matter of religious doctrine;" the general 
sense of "that which is believed" is by 1714. Related: Beliefs.

Belief meant "trust in God," while faith meant "loyalty to a person 
based on promise or duty" (a sense preserved in keep one's faith, 
in good (or bad) faith, and in common usage of faithful, faithless, 
which contain no notion of divinity). But faith, as cognate of 
Latin fides, took on the religious sense beginning in 14c. 
translations, and belief had by 16c. become limited to 
"mental acceptance of something as true," 
from the religious use in the sense of 
"things held to be true as a matter of religious doctrine."

<h2 class="subtitle">About <span>Us</span></h2>
<strong>We are the descendants</strong> of Anglo-Scottish-Prusso-Germanic
Australian migrants who settled in the newly formed colonies of New South Wales and Queensland
in the nineteenth century. The idea behind these pages is to present
the stories and characters of those early settlers along with information about their origins, descendants, families, whereabouts and activities.
<br><br>
There are often themes running through their struggles and
achievements telling a tale of resourcefulness and hardships in an alien world.
The paradox of Australia as an ancient and raw continent and as a 'New World' portrays
a collision of ideals and realities yet still shows a continuity in how those people dealt with everyday life.
