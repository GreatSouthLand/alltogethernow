    <h2><b>Fred and Jessie</b></h2>
    <br>
    
    Our grandparents on our mother's side, Fred and Jessie, were a whole generation older than our father's parents, thanks to Mum being born the youngest of eight children.  On February 28, 1906, Frederick Robert Fenwick, the son of Robert Thomas Fenwick and Hellen Rankin, married Jessie Halling McDonald, daughter of John McDonald and Jessie Halling McIntyre. Even though Fred and Jessie were both born in 1884, Fred had already turned 22 the month before but Jessie remained 21 until July that year. The ceremony was held at Alstonville where Fred was living at the time. Jessie was still with her family a few kilometers away at Meerschaumvale near Wardell.

    <h6>The Match That Lit a Fire</h6>
    
    Alstonville, located between Ballina and Lismore, was still a small town acting as the service centre for the Alstonville Plateau. Fred and his older brother, Bill, started a joinery business there in 1901. Together, they ran a large up-to-date workshop and even built houses and shops complete with fixtures, fittings, furniture and trims. Jessie in the meantime had just been bridesmaid to her older sister's wedding. Naturally enough by then she'd be on the lookout for her own beau. So one day, Jessie's match-making friend set up a rendezvous at the place where Fred was playing in a football match. 
    <br><br>
    It's clear from the wedding picture that Fred was handsome, but at that time he was sporting a bright red moustache and Jessie let it be known that she'd no more marry a man with a moustache than go to London. Fred promptly shaved it off and the match was made. In the wedding photo, Fred's boyish looks reveal a man who was recently missing a moustache. The couple's first child, Vic, was born a bit over a year later.

    <h6>The Brothers Fenwick and The Mill</h6>
    
    In 1908, Fred's parents, Robert and Hellen, went north to Queensland, first to Ipswich and then on to Cooroy. Since the timber industry was significantly declining where they were, the four Fenwick brothers followed on after their parents on a scouting trip to check out the lay of the land. 
    <br><br>
    The results were positive and so together they established a sawmill in conjunction with Robert Morrish at the lower end of Maple Street on the northern side of the township. The Fenwicks supplied the land, the skill and the labour and Morrish supplied the equipment from his recently closed mill in Alstonville along with his business know-how. The result was Cooroy's first mill, trading as "Canadian Sawmills". 
    <br><br>
    Sometime around 1912, the Fenwicks bought out Morrish's interest in the mill and the Fenwick Sawmill was born.Â George worked at the planer, Bill did the clerical work and Walter seems to have been reponsible for felling and hauling the timber used by the mill. In the meanwhile, Fred went back to building. He built most of the original buildings in Cooroy, including the Memorial Hall, shops and houses. All are still standing today.
    <br><br>
    The Fenwicks eventually sold out to Blanford, Llewellyn, Smith and Carter in 1929. In 1941 the mill was acquired by Straker & Sons, who enlarged it and traded as the Cooroy Sawmilling Company. They ceased sawing operations in 1972. The most recent incarnation was completely destroyed by fire in 2019.

    <h5>Jessie - Grandma Fenwick</h5>
    
    Jessie Halling McDonald was born on 9 July 1884 at Meerschaum Vale, about 15 km north of Broadwater and 6 km from Wardell where her parents' farm was. As well as that, her father, John McDonald, still had his original sugar-cane farm at East Wardell on the other side of the Richmond River. The cane farm was across the road from the shop owned by his father-in-law, Duncan McIntyre. Farming kept John rather busy so he was often absent from home and according to his granddaughter (our mother) he wasn't missed much, being such a strict father. 
    <br><br>
    Jessie was only four when her paternal grandfather, Alexander Duncan McDonald, died in 1888 but the family kept in touch with his widow, his second wife, Mary Ann Loaring, who continued living at their Broadwater farm. Grandma Jessie enjoyed going there. Her step grandmother was a kindly woman, and her house was right on the waterfront, only accessible by boat. Grandma's father, John McDonald, died in 1901 at the age of 58. His widow, Jessie's mother, was then 41 and left to raise their nine children ranging in age from 2 to 19.
    <br><br>

    In their 55 years of marriage, Jessie would sometimes call Fred a "Sassanak" when they argued. It was intended as an insult but was it fair? Highlanders supposedly called anybody who came from, or lived south of, the Highlands by that name. It was ultimately derived from their word for the Saxons whose invasion had been resisted for centuries. The Saxon lands included the Scottish Lowlands as much as it did England. 
    <br><br>
    Just like with Jessie, Fred's four grandparents were all immigrants from Britain. 
    On his father's side, his forebears had hailed from Yorkshire, yet always claimed the area had originally been part of Scotland and later claimed by the English. Fred's maternal grandparents were from Angus, which although technically is part of the Lowlands, falls into Highland territory as far as whisky classification goes. There's also a family legend that Granddad's father was left an inheritance by someone in Scotland, but it was seized by someone else before Granddad could travel to Scotland to claim it.
    <br><br>
    When, in her early forties, Jessie discovered that she was pregnant again (with our mother). She was so embarrassed by not recognising her condition that she didn't want to face her neighbours or Fred's workmates. She persuaded him to pack up and move to Brisbane to run a business as Cabinet Maker and French Polisher. The plan might have worked had it not been for the disastrous circumstances. As the Great Depression hit, not enough people could afford Fred's services, so the family was forced to move to Beaudesert to take up share-farming. 
    <br><br>
    As if it hadn't been hard enough for the couple, with Fred not being able to practice his trade and barely earning enough money to survive, things got worse. Their son Allan died from heart failure when he was only 13 years old. To add to the parents anguish, the Health Authorities forced an investigation to discover if it was typhoid, but eventually ruled it out as the cause of death. Of course, Jessie blamed herself for not having taken Allan to hospital early enough.     The youngest siblings, Walt and Joy also suffered guilt all their lives for failing to warn their brother to not drink from the school water-tank. He had been absent when all the other pupils had been told not to do so, because it had dried out. It was later thought that one possibile cause for his weakened heart was his exceptional spurt of growth. He had grown six feet tall by the time he died. To make things worse, the second world war broke out and Fred and Jessie's sons signed up and went into action. Two of them, Fred and Bill died, while Walter spent most of the war in the notorious Changi prison camp in Singapore the occupied by Japanese.

    <h5>Caloundra</h5>
    
    After so much grief, Fred and Jessie finally decided to retire to Caloundra, which is where we remember them to be. Their house in Mayes Estate, probably from the 1940s, had a front garden filled with hydrangeas. It was situated on an unsealed road running from the main Highway into Caloundra at one end right down to native bushland at the other. That was the route we took to get to school whenever we stayed in Caloundra. There was even more bushland behind the house too, where young ghost gums and coastal scrub managed to survive in the sandy soil.
    <br><br>
    In about 1962, Dad decided to go into business with Mum's brother, our Uncle Walt as independent wholesalers for K R Darling Downs Smallgoods. At this stage, Uncle Walt, his wife Aunty Fay and their four children lived next door to Grandma and Granddad, in a newish build, while Aunty Iris and her four sons had moved in with the grans after Iris's husband, Norm had died. Having put our house at Whitehill Road on the market, Mum and Dad and us three kids lived in a caravan parked in the back area of the two adjoining properties. They must have been big blocks because that area also housed Granddad's workshop, plus a shed (where we bathed in an old-fashioned copper tub) and a chicken coop. On Uncle Walt's side, there was also a large banana tree, which Rod infamously set alight one time. 
    <br><br>
    The cousins played hopscotch and marbles on the dirt road, and a game called Spooky in the evening in which we chased each other around the houses trying to avoid cane toads. We would also walk down to the corner shop to buy lollies or go for a swim at Bullock Beach. Another favourite past-time was playing board games in the Parson boys' room, which was a narrow crowded space next to the kitchen at the back of the house. 
    <br><br>
    Granddad died in 1961 when Rell and Rod were 6 and 4 respectively. We weren't much older when Grandma died in 1965, so our memories of them are hazy.

    <h6>Memories are made of this...</h6>
    
    Here are Rell's recollections (some heavily influenced by Mum's stories):
    <br><br>
    <b>The Grandmother Clock.</b> Grandma had always wanted a tall, standing grandfather cloth but she had to make do with the smaller grandmother version, which sat on a sideboard in the living room. Meals wouldn't be served until the clock chimed the correct hour.
    <br><br>
    <b>Johnny O'Keefe.</b> The clock had another duty too. Watching Johnny on Six O'Clock Rock was one of Grandma's pet habits.
    <br><br>
    <b>The Commode Chair.</b> After Granddad died, Grandma took to her bed a lot. Beside her bed, she kept a water jug protected by a shell-fringed doily. Along the wall sat a wooden commode chair, a stark reminder of how frail she was.
    <br><br>
    <b>The Kitchen.</b> Granddad used to make his porridge on the old cooker in the kitchen. It looked way too much like the feed he prepared for his darling chooks at the same time, so I could never be persuaded to try his favourite breakfast. I don't remember ever eating in the dining room, only at the wooden table in the kitchen.
    <br><br>
    <b>Two Bob.</b> When the grandchildren visited, she immediately gave each two shillings, and we'd race off to the local store to buy lollies.
    <br><br>
    <b>Her Kind Heart.</b> She effectively raised several nieces and nephews after her sister May died tragically. May had tripped over something on the floor, the wound went septic and she died despite having lost her hand and then her forearm.
    <br><br>
    
    
    <h6>And some more memories...</h6>
    
    Here are Rod's recollections (from a wee bairn's somewhat distorted point of view):
    <br><br>
    <b>Santa's Workshop.</b> One of the most outstanding memories I have of Granddad Fenwick was his seemingly huge workshop out the back of his house in Mayes Estate in Caloundra. Auntie Iris and her three boys were already visiting Grandma and Granddad by the time our family turned up for the usual Christmas reunion. Our cousins, who were somewhat older and knew their way around, decided to show us a sneak look at that workshop. We all had to be very quiet because Granddad didn't like to have the children mucking about in amongst all the dangerous tools and stuff. Anyway, throwing caution to the wind, we all marched into the workshop, which definitely looked like it was set up for making Santa's goodies. Immediately, we all got up to nonsense grabbing some chair padding fluffy stuff from a box, putting it round our chins and going ho ho ho. Well that triggered the alarm and in came Grandpa with a "What's going on here?"
    <br><br>
    <b>Vanguard of the New.</b> Granddad prided himself in his large family. On the occasion of a family reunion slated for occurring in a chosen parkland large enough for the entire gathering of an extended family, Mum and Dad and us kids were to meet up with the grandparents, uncles and aunts and cousins and all travel together to the big event. Granddad was especially proud of his newly acquired extra-large Vanguard saloon car, the latest and greatest in motoring experience. Dad said the boot was so big you could fit another car into it. Uncle Walt had a go at his father for having bought such a huge car. He replied that when you have a big family, you need a big car. I remember the front seat comfortably seated four adults across it while an innumerable number of kids were able to be stashed away easily on the back seat.
    <br><br>
    <b>The Photo Gallery.</b> Grandma was equally proud of her family and had granddad build her a shelf at picture rail height all around their seemingly enormous sitting room. On the shelf was every picture collected over many years. She would sometimes walk me through uncles, aunts and cousins and tell a short story about who it was and why they were so important to her. At the end of it, I still had no idea who any of them was but I did get the idea that she loved them very much.

<h2 class="subtitle">About <span>Us</span></h2>
<strong>We are the descendants</strong> of Anglo-Scottish-Prusso-Germanic
Australian migrants who settled in the newly formed colonies of New South Wales and Queensland
in the nineteenth century. The idea behind these pages is to present
the stories and characters of those early settlers along with information about their origins, descendants, families, whereabouts and activities.
<br><br>
There are often themes running through their struggles and
achievements telling a tale of resourcefulness and hardships in an alien world.
The paradox of Australia as an ancient and raw continent and as a 'New World' portrays
a colision of ideals and realities yet still shows a continuity in how those people dealt with everyday life.
