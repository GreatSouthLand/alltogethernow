<h1 class="title">Welcome To <span>Our Family</span></h1>
<div class="article-info box"></div>

<p><strong>By the 18th and 19th centuries, the Old World no longer supported the old ways.</strong> Change happened in an especially big way in the nineteenth century as people on the land as well as in the cities had to deal with the new machinery of industry. This was also the time of expansion into a New World which caused a lot of people to migrate; some because they wanted to be a part of that new world; others because they could no longer be a part of the old.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Those migrants and their descendants have not only survived the rigours of two centuries, but also a relative leap into the modern world, with some of them setting trends and the rest having to keep up with them. Many generations have passed since the wave of migration to new land and there are many stories to be told.
</p>
<br>

<strong>Yet change is not new</strong> and there has always been some wise-guy saying something about it:
<br>

<ul class="list1">
  <li>The old must make way for the new, and one thing must be built
  out of the ruins of another.<br>
   – Lucretius </li>
  <li>Don't forget who you are and where you come from.<br>
   – F. Scott Fitzgerald </li>
  <li>Knowing where you come from is one thing, but it's suicide to stay there.<br>
   – Dennis Covington </li>
</ul>

<h5>The Great South Land</h5>

All these families, for whatever reason they had, migrated to <strong>Australia</strong> or more correctly to the colonies of New South Wales and Queensland where they met up, sometimes inter-married and ultimately, are all together now (except for a few who returned).
<br>

<h5>A Family That Helped Build Australia</h5>

Our ancestors and their families were a busy bunch on both sides of the family. They were builders, contractors, wrights, masons and makers of all sorts of things. They built bridges, wharves, ships, boats, tunnels, big and small buildings, houses, shops, fixtures, fittings, coaches, wagons, wheels and even a mill. They established settlements, farms, studs, estates and emporiums, made footwear and clothing as well as supplies for horse and carriage. They baked bread, supplied food and essentials, formed communities, organisations, churches, schools, hospitals, and councils. They also kept themselves busy with inventions, innovations and maintenance. If that wasn't enough, many also turned their hand to breeding horses, dogs, sheep, cattle and poultry, winning many prizes as well. They even made money.

<h5>some more quotable quotes:</h5>

<ul class="list1">
  <li>Of all the small nations of this earth, perhaps only the ancient Greeks surpass the Scots in their contribution to mankind.<br>
  – Winston Churchill</li>
  <li>The Scots have a deep, abiding love of their country. They sing about it, write poems about it, even greet over it after a few drams; they’ll do everything but damned well stay in it.<br>
  – Speaker at a meeting in Dundee NZ from Jim Hewitson, Far Off in Sunlit Places 1998 p.3</li>
  <li>The migrants 'would rather die as slaves in America than be residents of Weinsberg'.<br>
  (die Auswanderer „wollen lieber sklaven in Amerika seyn als bürger in Weinsperg“.)<br>
  – Friedrich List in his Report to the government in Stuttgart</li>
</ul>

<h2 class="subtitle">About <span>Us</span></h2>
<strong>We are the descendants</strong> of Anglo-Scottish-Prusso-Germanic
Australian migrants who settled in the newly formed colonies of New South Wales and Queensland
in the nineteenth century. The idea behind these pages is to present
the stories and characters of those early settlers along with information about their origins, descendants, families, whereabouts and activities.
<br><br>
There are often themes running through their struggles and
achievements telling a tale of resourcefulness and hardships in an alien world.
The paradox of Australia as an ancient and raw continent and as a 'New World' portrays
a collision of ideals and realities yet still shows a continuity in how those people dealt with everyday life.
<br><br>
One and a half centuries later, the collectable information available to recreate
a realistic picture of these people is not altogether detailed or consistent. Yet there are
still many traces remaining that we have managed to gather together here.
<br><br>
<strong>A family history</strong> such as this is obviously full of impressions and opinions
laced together with as much historical information as is available but telling the complete story
or stories still remains to be seen. Very often only scant real information is available. <br>
We are very grateful to those people who have already put in a lot of effort, especially for
making records, articles and memorials available and to anyone interested in reading this <strong>so here's a hearty thanks!</strong>
