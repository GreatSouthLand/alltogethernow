    <h2><b>The Fassifern</b></h2>
    <br>
    
    In the second half of the nineteenth century, many people who migrated to Queensland settled in the Fassifern. Even people who had first landed in other districts eventually took up land there.
    <br><br>
    
    
    <h5>The Fassifern Valley</h5>
    
    The name "Fassifern Valley" is much used but without really describing where that valley actually is, other than being in the South East of Queensland, somewhat inland from Brisbane. The first mentions of Fassifern Valley came from newspapers of the early 20th century to refer to farms hewn out of the the brigalow scrub in the Fassifern district, aptly called the Fassifern Scrub. The articles speak glowingly of a beautiful valley, rich in fertile soils. The area grew into a parish, a district and an electorate but Fassifern Valley was not mentioned with any of these.
    <br><br>
    
    <!--It seems to be have been mostly used by journalists to refer to farming land in the Fassifern, glowingly reported as rich and fertile. Still, the precise location of this valley remains undefined.
    <br><br>-->
    
    In an attempt to locate it geographically, it's fairly well agreed to have its western boundary at the Little Liverpool Range. To the north is the district of Ipswich. On the south is the northern border of New South Wales. Yet the eastern side is a little blurry. Some say it stops at the Teviot Range yet many of the places supposedly in the Fassifern Valley lie on the eastern side of that range, perhaps the valley spread as far over as the Dugandan Range.
    <br><br>
    
    Running through the middle are the Bremer River and a number of creeks such as Warrill Creek, Reynolds Creek, Teviot Brook, Burnett Creek and Washpool Gully. It is now also home to Lake Moogerah and the Maroon Dam.
    <br><br>
<!--
    Nevertheless, Fassifern Valley remains a region which is not properly defined geographically or politically. The name was very likely first used in newspapers to refer to farms hewn out the the brigalow scrub in the Fassifern district, aptly called the Fassifern Scrub. The area grew into a parish, a district and an electorate but Fassifern Valley was not mentioned with any of these.
    <br><br>
-->    
<!--
    Geographically, the Fassifern Valley is a region about 60 miles inland from Brisbane. The valley lies between the Little Liverpool Range to the west and the Teviot Range to the east. More recently the name Fassifern Valley jumps over the Teviot Range, and stretches further east to the Dugandan Range. Directly north is the district of Ipswich. On the southern boundary is the northern border of New South Wales. 
    
    Running through the middle are the Bremer River and a number of creeks such as Warrill Creek, Reynolds Creek, Teviot Brook, Burnett Creek and Washpool Gully. It is now also home to Lake Moogerah and the Maroon Dam.

    The Victoria Tunnel
    <img src="img/schneider/victoria_tunnel.jpg" class="modal-img" onclick="clk(this)" alt="" style="margin:8px 0px -3px 0px;">
    </div>

    The eastern edge, the Little Liverpool Range, is a spur running off the Main Range, both of which are part of the Great Dividing Range. The Little Liverpool Range is famous for being the obstacle which was overcome by the botanist and explorer Allan Cunningham who was searching for a means to connect the coastal area to the Darling Downs lying on the other side of the Great Dividing Range and bordering on New England. The famous crossing he found on August 25, 1828 was eventually named Cunningham's Gap in his honour. 
    <br><br>
    
    
    
    The Little Liverpool Range is also well known for being a hindrance to the construction of the Ipswich to Toowoomba rail line. To overcome the problem two tunnels were burrowed through the range, the first of which was the 120m long Little Liverpool Tunnel, and the other one being the 500m long Victoria Tunnel, the longest and oldest rail tunnel in Queensland. Being stone masons, the Schneider family, who arrived in 1864 and 1865 from Wuerttemberg in Germany, contributed by cutting the stone used for the Victoria Tunnel.
    <br><br>
    
    The official boundaries of the Electoral District of Fassifern, which existed from 1873 to 1992, very closely align with those of the Fassifern Valley itself. On the other hand, The Parish of Fassifern is closer to the original Fassifern Run established by John Cameron in 1842. As specified by government regulations, both a parish and a run were confined to about 25 square miles in size.

    <h5>The Making of the Fassifern Valley in Prehistory</h5>
    
    Long before Queensland separated from New South Wales, Australia had separated from the super continent of Gondwana, a huge land mass connecting Australia and the Antarctic. The drift started about 300 million years ago and the land masses were completely disconnected some 60 to 86 million years ago. Through the study of exposed land in the Antarctic there have been major discoveries revealing the previous existence of marsupials and similar rock and soil to Australia.
    <br><br>
    
    As a result of the migration of the Australian continental land mass over the tectonic plate known as the Australian Plate, enormous shield volcanoes were formed in what is now South East Queensland, in particular the Main Range Volcano, where Fassifern now lies, the Focal Peak Volcano near Mount Barney and the Tweed Volcano, centered on Mt Warning in the Tweed district. The first to erupt was the Main Range Volcano and resulted in much molten volcanic rock (mostly basalt) erupting and flowing over what is now the fertile valley of the Fassifern.
    <br><br>
    
    
    
    
    
    <h5>The Original Inhabitants</h5>
    
    Well before the British invasion of Australia, the Fassifern was occupied by the Ugarapul (a modern term, otherwise Yaggerabul, Yugarabul etc) people who knew it by the name of Yagera (or Yaggera etc). How long they had lived there is uncertain but it is surmised that aboriginal people have inhabited Australia for the past 65,000 years or so, having also survived the ice-age. <!--In 2006, Dixon and Ramson said that the--> <!--The Australian English word 'yakka', loosely meaning 'work', as in 'hard yakka' came from the Yuggera word 'yaga' meaning 'strenuous work', for which farming in the Fassifern is renowned (1933, Enid Bell and Susan (Bunjoey) at Coochin Coochin Station).-->
    <br><br>

    Although most early 'settlers' have glowing reports about mixing well with the original inhabitants, their established way of life, or possibly their sheer existence conflicted most of all with the very English mentality of the Crown's newly appointed authorities, who came bearing guns, and used them openly against the 'natives'. The aim, of course, was to drive them and any native animals and plants out of existence. 
    <br><br>
    
    Government surveyors adopted many aboriginal place names which continue being used today. The following lists some of those in the Fassifern Valley (derived from "Aboriginal Placenames of South East Queensland" - Qld Govt) from the Yugera / Yugarabul language.

    Europeans are very often blamed for destroying the original landscape but it must be noted that for the 50,000 years before the Europeans arrived, the indigenous inhabitants regularly cleared the land for pasturing kangaroos.  <br>
    As remarked in "An environmental history of Moreton Bay":

    The distribution of rainforest was observed by explorer Ludwig Leichhardt to reflect soil water availability, although the starkness of the boundary between the vegetation communities suggested, even to the pioneers, that Aborigines regularly burned the country. Much of the country inland from the coast was open.

    <h5>Flora and Fauna</h5>
    
    The Fassifern Valley has a rather unique history when it comes to its vegetation and inhabitants and even today, some rare examples are still being discovered. After decades of clearing for cultivation, some remaining 'untouched' sections of rainforest and bushland are now part of national parks and wildlife reserves. 
    
    Once upon a time, sub-tropical rainforests, eucalypts, vines, brigalow and heath were growing abundantly over the peaks, gorges, cliffs, ridges and plains of the Fassifern. Mount French is still home to the remaining brigalow scrub which previously dominated the area. Rare lichens and slender milkvines unique to Fassifern are still found in protected pockets on higher ground. 
    <br><br>

    <p>Black-breasted Button-quail</p>
    </div>
    
    Brush-tailed rock wallabies and ground-dwelling black-breasted button-quails still find refuge in the mountains. 
    
    
    On the brink of extinction, the 9.7 cm long Fassifern Blind Snake has been found living at Warrill View. 
    
    Australia's largest nocturnal avian predator, the powerful owl, Ninox strenua is also present. 
    Black cockatoos feed on forest she-oaks and peregrine falcons, capable of diving at over 180 km/hr, sometimes present their formidable predatory skills when chasing their prey. 
    Many hundreds more different types of creatures nowadays find home in the Main Range National Park and neighbouring forests. 
    
    <br><br>
    At the start of the eighteenth century, explorers in their travel notes often described overwhelmingly large groups of wallabies, wallaroos, emus, cockatoos, kangaroos, koalas and so on, which are unfortunately no longer to be seen in such quantities, having been driven off by aggressive culling and agriculture. The first pastoral runs were set up by squatters who drove their livestock into the plains for free. As time passed by the government demanded licensing of these runs at a nominal fee of usually 10 pounds per year, simply to keep track of who was where. Those runs eventually turned into leases and then selections, all controlled by the systematic occupation of the land by European migrants.

    The earliest Europeans to explore the region later known as the Fassifern were Scots. The first attempt was made in 1827 by the notoriously detested Commandant of the Moreton Bay Penal Settlement, Captain Patrick Logan who hailed from Berwickshire in Scotland. At the very same time, the botanist Allan Cunningham, a Scot from Renfrewshire made his way up from the Upper Hunter Valley guided by the Perthshire Scot Peter McIntyre but the party was eventually forced back by the terrain. In 1828 Cunningham made another attempt, this time setting out from Moreton Bay, accompanied by Logan and yet another Scot, the Colonial Botanist Charles Fraser from Blair Atholl in Perthshire. Of course, Cunningham's main interest was his obsession over finding a gap in the Great Dividing Range that would allow the Darling Downs to be connected to Brisbane, for which he was successful on July 24.

    <h5>Climate</h5>
    
    Fassifern, being in South East Queensland has a sub-tropical climate influenced by tropical systems from the north and fluctuations of the high pressure ridge to the south which bring about warm wet summers and mild dry winters.

    <h5>The Beginning of Fassifern, The Run and The Neighbours </h5>
    
    
    For almost two decades prior to British settlement of the region, the area now known as Fassifern Valley was included in the administration of the Moreton Bay Penal Settlement of New South Wales. The settlement stretched from Stradbroke Island, across Redland Bay, through Brisbane and on to Limestone (Ipswich). As such, no land within 50 miles of these places could be occupied, namely by any squatters wishing to depasture their livestock. This all changed on 10th February, 1842 when the Governor of New South Wales, George Phipps, declared the penal settlement to be closed and the district open for free settlement. 
    On the 5th of May, 1842, Governor Phipps proclaimed the Moreton Bay District to have come into existence.
    <br><br>
    
    John Cameron (1811-1862) didn't waste time to become the first to take up land in this new frontier having been granted a Depasturing License running from July 1, 1842 to June 30, 1843. Cameron was born 11 August 1811 in Stirling, Scotland and was the son of the former soldier, early colonist and pastoralist, Hugh Cameron (1774-1851) and wife Jessie Robertson (1789-1873), who had settled on 1280 acres they named Kingdon Ponds, near Scone in the Hunter Valley. Hugh's close friend, the Surveyor General, Thomas Livingston Mitchell, who had recommended the location, was instrumental in fulfilling Hugh's wish to establish a town alongside the property and name it Scone, after where the Stone of Destiny was held in Scotland.
    <br><br>
    
    In 1836, John had been the first settler in New England, having driven a herd of 500 cattle up from the Hunter Valley to his new property located at Abington Creek which he named Lochiel Run but was later known as Abington Station. 
    Lochiel was a historic place just east of the Fassifern near Fort William in Scotland, and was once home to the Clan Cameron's chieftain, Donald Cameron. Another story has John taking up Bannockburn Station near Inverell in 1837, where his father Hugh was to remain after John moved to Fassifern. Soon to follow Cameron to New England were more Hunter Valley pastoralists. For instance, agent John Falconer took up Falconer Plain for Donald McIntyre as well as Guyra for Peter McIntyre.

    Yet, John Cameron shouldn't be viewed as a lone settler in what was to become the Fassifern. Having firmly established himself as a squatter in the new district, he was soon joined by his  his parents, Hugh and Jessie, as well as his four sisters and their husbands who also claimed the neighbouring runs. Some years later, in 1850, after having moved to Undulla, John was married to Emmeline Clark in Brisbane. 
    
    Altogether the families took up large neighbouring runs which eventually became the district of Fassifern:

    John's wife, Emmeline, passed away 3 Dec 1861 at the age of only 34, probably from complications after giving birth, and was also buried at Undulla. John became grief stricken and desperate and taken into the care of his wife's sister, Rachel, and her husband, Campbell Livingstone  McDonald. Tragically, John managed to escape their watchful eye and took his own life on 18 Oct 1862. The orphaned children were left to the care of the McDonalds, as well as John's widowed sister, Jessie McDonald, and John and Jessie's mother, Jessie Cameron, nee Robertson.

    <p>The Fassifern Estate as advertised in 1906<br>
    </p>
    </div>
    </div>
    
    
    After John Cameron, Fassifern was sold to William Kent, then in 1857 it belonged to the partnership of E. &amp; A. Wienholt and Kent. In 1860, under the partnership of Wienholt and J. Hardie, it was consolidated with the neighbouring Moogerah and Tarome, under the single name of Fassifern. After Hardie withdrew from the partnership, it was renamed to 'Estate of Wienholt and Co.' but by 1909, Fassifern only entailed the homestead block.
    <br><br>
    
    With Queensland having separated from New South Wales and becoming a colony in its own right, changes in government policy set forth a scheme to encourage settlement of the land formally only in the hands of a few run owners who had originally been squatters. All of the runs in the district, were at first split in half, with one part being leased, usually to the former lessee, and the other, called reclaimed land, which was then surveyed into smaller blocks and made available for selection by private people, namely migrants. Eventually all the land followed suit.
    <br><br>
    
    Needless to say, wealthy pastoralists and businessmen such as George Thorn, Benjamin Cribb and his brother-in-law, John Foote, as well as the Wienholt brothers, nabbed the opportunity first and snatched up an inordinate number of blocks which had become available. 
    
    Before the full scale advertising of the estate, many German migrants saw an opportunity to take up the 'cheaper' land and work hard clearing the brigalow scrub country unwanted by those who preferred something easy. 
	<br><br>
	
	In 1944, in a series of letters to the Queensland Times, Thos. W. Hardcastle of Carney's Creek via Boonah, recalled that the McDonald brothers cut the first track through the scrub towards Ipswich. At that time it was only a packhorse track. In the early days, the mail was run from Ipswich to Mt. Lindsay to meet up with the mail coming from New South Wales. It was simply tipped out on the side of the road and the settlers had to rummage through it to pick out their own mail.

	THE SECOND SECTION OF THE FASSIFERN RAILWAY<br>
	[BY OUR SPECIAL REPORTER] 
	<br><br>

	The second section of the Fassifern Railway, from Harrisville to Dugandan, in length about seventeen miles - from Ipswich to [Harrisville is eighteen miles - is now very nearly completed, and a short description of it may not be without interest to some of your readers, for it is an extension of a local branch, and the builder is well known here, he being no other than Mr. George Bashford. Through the courtesy of that gentleman and some of his chief officials, I was, last week, afforded the opportunity of having a run over the greater portion of the line, and gleaning some information regarding it. 
    <br><br>
    
	A good many townsfolk will remember the holiday ceremonial in honour of the commencement of the work, and perhaps they will feel a pleasure in hearing of the progress made. A part of this section - from the spot where it enters the scrub to the terminus - will certainly not be the least interesting piece of line in this district ; on the contrary, it will have some attraction for passengers to whom the country is new. The district there is a scrub farming one, and patches of cultivation alternate with the still standing scrub, but as the route often lies along the back of the selections - that is, away from the dray-roads - more scrub is seen than might be expected, though, no doubt, much more of the line frontage will soon have its face changed. 
	<br><br>
	
	The "forest primeval" - in which the "murmuring pines and hemlocks" of Longfellow's Arcadia are represented by the towering brigalow, with here and there a tall pine or a portly bottle-tree, and all about a vast variety of smaller timber, up which often the vulgar pumpkin-vine makes a trailing ascent, until actually the scrub trees pumpkins bear - will, in time, give place to "vast meadows" and corn-fields stretching to eastward and westward, and pastures for large numbers of stock, for the hilly scrub has a fertile soil, and all of it in this locality seems capable of being brought under the sway of the husbandman. Were it not for the sight of an occasional farm-house, a stranger might now ask for more signs of the reputed numerous population of our scrub lands. The men are there, and so are the women and children. One needs but to go up and down scrub lands to see this, and the population, which is very largely made up of German settlers, is a thriving and industrious, thought often unobtrusive, one. The farmers prefer to remain at work rather than sport and show themselves about, as some do. Somewhat of the 'Arcadian simplicity," perhaps, characterizes their life, and, to continue the similie, it might also be said of them that they are
	<br><br>

	Men whose lives glide on like rivers that water the woodlands, <br>
	Darkened by shadows of earth, but reflecting an Image of heaven. <br>
	May it never be said of the scrub and its people <br>
	Waste are those pleasant farms, and the farmers for ever be parted. 
	<br><br>
	
	These scrub farmers, be they Teuton, Celt, or Saxon, who overcome the wilderness, are too good colonists for us to wish them away, though some people profess to hold them in light estimation and speak sneeringly of the "cockatoo" farmers and "kaisers." Still the "cockey" of to-day may before long be approvingly designated "the prosperous landholder and agriculturalist." But this is a digression, and intended only to direct attention to the "prettiest" portion of the Fassifern line. The second section starts at Harrisville, at the 18-mile peg, with a small cutting, and a quarter of a mile further on Mr. Bashford has a steam stone-crusher, for making ballast out of the hard blue metal rock of the hill above. Mr. Robert Dunn's property is passed through, and then comes some low-lying and some ti-tree land. The country is pretty level for three and a half miles, and there are on it no special features to note. There Are but five bridges or flood-openings on the section, and no creeks have to be crossed. Three of these viaducts are on the level piece of land referred to. Normanby Gully is crossed three-quarters of a mile from Harrisville, and at 2 miles 5 chains is Wilson's Plains station. The buildings are completed ready for traffic. 
	<br><br>
	
	There are a goods and shelter shed and platform, and the residence is near the gate, where there is a level crossing not far from the Milora-road. One of the Government inspectors, Mr. J. K. Batchelor, who, in spite of his name, seems to be a family man, lives at the station pending the completion of the work, The properties of Messrs. T. Roderick and J. and W. Welch are passed soon after this, and Dinner Camp Gully is net crossed. At the 3m, 4ch, is the residence and office of Mr. H. V. Fraser, the assistant engineer who represents the Government on the section during its progress. When he leaves, this building will be a gate-house. The contractor's office and main camp are at 4m, 2oh. close to the Green Swamp. Here Mr. Bashford has a saw-mill, forges, and the usual appurtenances of a contractor's camp.
	<br><br>
	
	Pitt's Hotel is also in the 'township:" and on the other (the left-hand) side of the line is a gate-house, now occupied by Mr. G. K. Seabrook. Mr. Bashford's clerk and bookkeeper. At 5m, 1Och. is the Fassifern (railway) station, on what was some of the Messrs. Wienbolt's property before it was resumed for railway purposes. The buildings here are ready for traffic. Thirty chains farther on the line crosses the Warwick-road, the work still being light; a gate and cottage are provided here. The line trends to the left very much a few miles from Harrisville, which is not on the direct route to Dugandan. The dray-road for the latter place leaves the Warwick-road at the Peak Crossing, goes through the scrub beyond the One-eye Water hole, and passes along near the Teviot (brook or creek) for a few miles before approaching the Railway terminus, thirty-one or thirty-two miles from Ipswich. while the line is in the shape of a bow from the Peak, through Harrisville and the Fassifern Scrub to Dugandan, its length from Ipswich being thirty-five miles. 
    <br><br>
    
	After crossing the Warwick-road, the route is through rougher country, and a considerable ascent is commenced, as could be plainly seen from the ballast engine, on which the writer had as pleasant a ride, in the invigorating fresh air, as he ever expects to have over the same route in a carriage. Tom Siddons was Mr. Bashford's "boss" in charge of this ballast-train, and he is very obliging in the matter of giving a person a run up or down the line. At 6m, 50ch. is the temporary residence of Mr. D. Reid, bridge inspector, and, judging his appearances, a near relative of the renowned Falstaff. Still ascending a grade of 1 in 50, some cuttings are entered and the farm of Messrs. Brooks and G. Gordon, sen., is passed through. Ballast is being broken here, for, though the soil is good, basaltic boulders crop out in some of the ridges. At the head of a small gully the late sect weather (and the breaking of the surface soil) has caused a considerable wash-out and break-away in the deep black soil, and stone-pitching has been resorted to in order to stop further damage. A very fine view may be obtained from the hill in this vicinity. The next station is named Blantyre, (at 8 miles 30 chains), and is in Mr. P. Bigan's land. 
	<br><br>
	
	It is some distance back in the scrub from Blantyre, or the One-eye, and is not worthy of the name of "station." It has been given but a shelter-shed, and we were surprised to notice the absence of a goods-shed in such a locality. The line now passes through a series of deeper cuttings on the scrub hills, still on a rising grade ; and the effects of the wet weather are apparent, for the sides of the cuttings have slipped in places, and the banks have sunk considerably, thus necessitating a lot of extra labour by the contractor. Plate-laying at this spot in the rainy season must have been a dirty job. The highest point of she line is reached at 11 miles 20 chains, where the elevation is 442ft. above Harrisville, the elevation of the latter being 270ft. Where land has been resumed from the cultivated and fenced pieces here, the Government have placed along the line, instead of the ordinary enclosure, a fence consisting of split posts and top rail, with "marsupial" wire-netting secured by three stout wires. A person who has seen such fences largely used, remarked that horned cattle are apt to seriously damage such a fence, which, in his opinion was not equal to a good two-nail one, though it must be remembered that the object in this instance is to exclude wallabies and the like.
	<br><br>
	
	From the summit, half a mile of down-grade brings Teviotville station abreast of the train (11 miles 60 chains). Here a very fine view of the mountains and ranges around and away towards the New South Wales border may be obtained. The necessary buildings are in course of construction on what was known as Herloch's farm. This station is in the very heart of the scrub, and a thoroughfare runs between it and the main Dugandan-road past Teviotville, two and a half miles away. [??] cuttings than before are soon brought into view. The largest and deepest is at 12 miles 20 chains It contained 15,000 cubic yards of muck, and is about 20ft deep It is familiarly known as Tom's Cutting" so named after the contractor's brother-in-law. Mr. Gosler's farm, one of the best on the line, apparently is reached at the 13-mile and 65 chains farther on there is a platform on the main line, where passengers may be taken up or set down. The iron horse now careers through Zilke's farm - spelling of proper names not guaranteed in this broken (English) country - and then through Fred Schneider's, where there is a nice little homestead on the side of the cutting and on a well-tended farm. 
	<br><br>
	
	From such houses as these no doubt the frau and frauleins will often wave a welcome to the passengers as the train speeds on its way down the slope or puffs up it. At 15 miles 20 chains comes No. 76 cutting, a pretty heavy one through a sort of sandstone rock, which was taken out by Mr. T. Fullelove, sen., who did a deal of the cutting on this section. Mr. August Schwarz's land is next reached, and the line is carried round the point of a steep ridge and on to Kent's Flat. Here are the other two large wooden water-ways, with embankments of fair size at either end and between. The route then lies through Mr. John Betts's paddock, in which, on the right-hand side, is the owner's very neat cottage. A little ascent here, and the 16-mile peg is reached, just at Blumbergville, the most suitable spot for a stopping-place and siding at this township, though, so far, no such provision has been made. On the ridge there is only about a couple of chains of quite level road, and passing the school there is plenty of room for a station, but there is a (down) grade of 1 in 50, which stands in the way. 
	<br><br>
	
	The Dugandan Flat, flooded so badly in January last, is close by, but, in order to avoid it the railway is carried round the base of some pretty steep hills which abut on the flat and dip to a couple of large lagoons, which a person stated he feared would be partly filled with earth washed from the railway embankments, though I do not think that the Railway Department will allow their banks to be so wasted. These will, no doubt, soon become grass-covered, and the now loose soil will thus be bound. There is a rather picturesque piece of sidelong work, like that on the Brisbane Valley line, between Vernors and Lowood, where the road-way rests on a "bench," so to speak, scarped out of the side of the hills. Here Mr. Hugh Shanks was building large ballast-shoots for Mr. Bashford, the facilities for obtaining the stuff being exceptional. 
	<br><br>
	
	Plate-laying had not quite reached this point, for the contractor has been put to great inconvenience owing to the frequent non-arrival of required supplies of rails from the Government. He estimates that certain portions of the work have already cost him a heavy percentage above the schedule price, while the wet weather has also lessened his profits. Had the ballast referred to been near the other end of the line it might have compensated him more for these unexpected draw-backs, but he was obliged to obtain some ballast in order to have a little to use as plate-laying progressed, the Government not allowing ballast trains to run unless the line is first "packed." Mr. Bashford says it will pay him now (after having taken so much ballast up the line) to bring down ballast from the top shoots to make up the required complement all along the line to Harrisville. 
	<br><br>
	
	The hills referred to as abutting on the Dugandan Flat are covered with herbage, and have on them a strange mixture of trees - chiefly apple-tree, silver-leaved ironbark, and grass-tree; but the hills themselves are masses of broken stone and reddish soil. The stuff is not rotten stone, but nicely-broken, hard, angular ballast, mixed with earth. The high, one-sided cuttings show that a great depth of this volcanic debris rests on a soft sandstone bed, in which peaty traces, as of coal indications, are to be seen. So far there there is scarcely a piece of stone in the hills large enough to require breaking, but the stuff may be screened, to separate the muck, and tipped into the shoots, which are on the main line. The ballast-trucks may be drawn alongside and filled from the shoots almost in an instant, thus saving a lot of shovelling, and consequently time and money. 
	<br><br>
	
	The shoots are at the 16 miles 32 chains, and from this to the terminus, in Mr. Hardcastle's paddock, very nearly seventeen miles from Harrisville, the line is, of course, pretty well on a level. The necessary building, including, we believe, timber-stages, goods-shed, and tank-stand, will soon be erected at the terminus, but little has been done yet beyond making up the road-ways. A good deal of road-work (by the Divisional Board) will be needed before the terminus can be conveniently approached; and the people up the creek think it very strange that the line was not continued a few chains further, to a better site; but, like the Teutonic settler who said he did not want more rain, but would take it if it came, the people must take the line as it has been made, though, of course, they may exercise the Briton's prerogative of grumbling. 
	<br><br>
	
	One thing can hardly escape the notice of the careful observer, and that is that at every curve along this section pieces of steel rail are to be seen lying about - some of the rails are of Welsh and others of German (Krupp) make. The Government require the joints on both lines of the metals to be even- that is to say, the two joints must be between the same pair of sleepers, which are set more closely together than usual. Of course, in going round a curve the outer line of rail is longer, for a given distance of road, than is the line of rail on the concave of the curve. Hence, to make the joints even, a few inches have to be cut off most of the inside rails, and this necessitates a great deal of hand boring of the rails, for the bolts which secure the fish-plates to them. 
	<br><br>

	Could not this waste of time and material be obviated by the Government keeping supplies of shorter rails? Those waste pieces of steel should be valuable if there were facilities for working them up, for perhaps they would be too much for the bush blacksmith. It may be mentioned that, though there are so few large wooden viaducts on the line, there are numbers of box-drains and concrete culverts, the latter seemingly being now more in favour than small wooden culverts. The earth-work on the greater part of the line is pretty heavy as contracts have been going lately, and the tender for the job is at the rate of nearly £5000 per mile. The work of plate-laying will soon be sufficiently advanced for Miss Bashford to drive the last spike, and her father will not be sorry to get the line off his hands as soon as possible, for, though he has a good margin of time - till the end of June - he says he may be able to finish the contract about the beginning of that month. The people at the head of the line are just as anxious as Mr. Bashford to see traffic opened, and are endeavouring to get Mr. Bashford to carry mails, passengers, and goods on his ballast train in the meantime if the Government will allow him. Evidently the line will be a great convenience to many, and the granting of a further extension would be good news to not a few. 
	<br><br>
	
	Before concluding, we may state that the contractor's engineer is Mr. W. Highfield, who has superintended various similar works for him and others, and to whom we are indebted for much of the information contained in this description. Mr. Highfield lives now at Rosebrook, once the residence of the late Mr. C. Thorn. Finally, the future running of trains on the Fassifern line is greatly exercising the minds of some people. One gentleman said that he and others would like to see an early up train leave Ipswich a few minutes after the arrival of the main up train from Brisbane, and one leave Dugandan in the afternoon - say between 1 and 4 o'clock. On our branches, early down trains have been arranged for the convenience, presumably, of the majority of users of the lines, and to run early trains both ways would necessitate a double supply of rolling-stock and an extra staff of men. I would advise those interested to talk the matter well over, obtain information as to what trains are likely to be run, agree on what will best suit the majority of them, and ask the Commissioner in time, to try and so arrange the new time-table as to meet general requirements. All cannot be suited; but while I feel sure that the Commissioner would like to satisfy the people who use the line, it cannot be agreeable to him to be frequently asked to alter existing arrangements.

	<h5>Development of The Fassifern</h5>


	As to be expected, the more the land was settled, the more commercial it became. Towns, villages and other settlements sprang up like mushrooms all over the Fassifern to deal with the increased needs, stemming mostly from private enterprise, especially in the agricultural arena. These places gradually became networked by roads and eventually by rail. In fact, it was the railway line and its stations which contributed greatly to the naming and growth of particular communities which, as time went by, became important centres for the district. The movement of goods in and out of the region was one of the most important facets of early life in this budding and blossoming district.
	<br><br> 
	
    On July 10, 1882, the Fassifern Railway Line was officially opened and hailed as the first agricultural branch line to be built in Queensland. Initially it ran for 17 miles from Ipswich to Harrisville but by 1887 had been extended another 18 miles to reach Boonah and Dugandan, described then as a scrub farming district. 
    <br><br>
    
    That year, a reporter for the Queensland Times captured the spirit of the new line by recounting impressions of it as a passenger on the train passing along it just before the line officially opened. He describes the countryside in glowing detail and includes some details about the residents, such as:

    <h5>Fassifern Scrub and Agriculture</h5>
    
    The lands of the Fassifern where a lot of Germans took up selections was originally scrub country covered by the extremely tenacious Brigalow. The name "Fassifern Scrub", though, was also the previous place name of Engelsburg which eventually changed to Kalbar. Yet many other places, such as Franklyn Vale, were still referred to as being in the Fassifern Scrub.
    <br><br>
    
    Fassifern was often a newsworthy topic in the papers, as the following snippets reveal.
    <br><br>
    
    In April 1866, Walter Hill, the Selector of Agricultural Reserves wrote in the Brisbane Courier:
    <div style="width:90%; padding: 0px 40px 20px 20px; margin: 6px 0px 10px 0px;">
    <i>
    The next place I visited was the Town Reserve of Fassifern situated on the Warrill Creek. On each bank of the creek for miles above the town boundary, there is some excellent land for agricultural purposes, which has the advantage of being well watered and suitably timbered. The quantity I beg to recommend for reservation at present is about seven thousand acres. By way of a practical illustration of the quality of the soil, I may mention that I observed some farms in the neighbourhood containing crops of maize, vegetables, &amp;c, which I have seldom seen equalled elsewhere.

    <p>Maroon, 1891 <br> (by G. H. Taylor)
    </p>
    </div>
    
    Later, in May 1877, a Special Reporter for the Brisbane Courier visited the scrub country:
    <div style="width:90%; padding: 0px 40px 20px 20px; margin: 6px 0px 10px 0px;">
    <i>
    Being within a few miles of Fassifern, I accepted the invitation of Mr. Moffatt, with whom I stayed the night, to change horses and go round the Fassifern scrub farms. The distance was only eight miles and the road being level and sound made it pleasant work. I say the road, but it must not be supposed that any Government made road exists here. The track is simply one made by the wheels of the settlers' drays, and it winds in and out amongst the trees, wherever the bush is most clear.
    <br></i>...and...<i><br>
    A number of farmers have settled down in this scrub, principally Germans, with a sprinkling of Irish and English. The appearance of these farms, newly cut out of the dense rosewood scrub, reminded forcibly of the old days on the Brisbane and Oxley Creek, when the first settlers commenced to hew out their farms. Here was a small opening cleared by the axe and by fire, which looked Lilliputian from a distance when compared with the enormous extent of scrub still standing; there a crop of maize surrounded by a wallaby fence, gave evidence of the richness of the soil.
    </i>
    </div>
    
    
    In the July 18, 1934 edition of The Bulletin, a writer said:
    <div style="width:90%; padding: 0px 40px 20px 20px; margin: 6px 0px 10px 0px;">
    <i>
    When the Fassifern scrub was thrown open for selection round about 60 years ago, wiseacres predicted that the land — most of it stiff black soil about 18 inches deep — would be worthless after producing a crop or two. But after more than half a century of intense cultivation the Fassifern scrub farms are still doing well. 
    </i>
    </div>
    
    This short walk through the history of farming in the area gives a bit of perspective as to what was going on at the start of settlement. 
    The first crops of wheat grown in the district of West Moreton were under Government supervision at a place called Little Plain which is now known as the Ipswich Racecourse. That was while the area was still a Penal Settlement and after being opened up to free settlement in 1842, wheat was continued to be grown there. 
    <br><br>
    
    Yet it wasn't until 1858 that the free settlers took up the cultivation of wheat. Despite the fact that some milling was possible at that time, only a few farmers were able to supply the necessary quantity for it to be profitable. As a result, and with the lure of government subsidies, there was a swing towards growing cotton. As to be expected there was quickly a glut on the market and the farmers rapidly lost interest.
    <br><br>
    
    Subsequently, there was a swing back to growing wheat, this time in the Rosewood and Fassifern scrubs as well as other parts of the district. The new farmers were also growing in numbers and were willing to work hard to produce enough to support their families. The German colonists were able to use hand mills to grind grains into flour to produce their own breads. In 1876, James Cribb opened a flour mill in Ipswich which supplied the necessary impetus to upscale grain farming to be profitable. This became a jubilant win for the farmers who were determined to grow something greater than simply allowing wild grasses to be turned into beef or mutton.

    <h5>Ipswich and the Fassifern</h5>
    
    At the time the Fassifern was growing, farmers needed supplies for running their business as well as markets to take their produce. These were early days for South East Queensland and Ipswich rapidly became more important than Brisbane. At the beginning of the 1860's Ipswich was declared a customs port and was connected to Brisbane via steamers travelling up and down the Bremer and Brisbane Rivers. 
    <br><br>
    From Brisbane, which had the facilities for larger vessels, the collected produce could be sent further afield, especially to Sydney and from there to England. The quantity of passengers and goods being transported grew so quickly that the government decided that a rail connection would be the best solution to deal with the new demands.
    <br><br>
    The first railway in Queensland was built from Ipswich towards Bigges Camp (Grandchester) in the opposite direction to, and away from, Brisbane. The intention was to ultimately connect Ipswich to the Darling Downs, via Toowoomba. All of the parts for the railway including tracks and trains were made in England, shipped to Moreton Bay and delivered from there to Ipswich via the regular paddle-steamers. 
    <br><br>

    <p>Ipswich in 1866 &nbsp; (by J. R. Ashton)
    </p>
    </div>
    
    The establishment of Bigges Camp as a base for construction, necessarily demanded a work force which was mainly provided by migrants, mostly German. 
    The majority of these early migrants eventually settled on the land south of Bigges Camp, that is, in the Fassifern valley. Many of them had worked in Ipswich before turning to the railway, mainly because that is where the colonial authorities had sent them upon arrival.
    <br><br>
    
    
    
    When the new railway being built was extended to run through the Fassifern, greater opportunity and attractiveness to select the government promised land there, led to an invasion of Germans taking up land, clearing it, and creating farms almost out of nothing barring hard labour. Naturally enough, Ipswich remained the commercial center for this growing area. 
    <br><br>
    
    Although based in Ipswich, entrepreneurs who also owned land in the valley, like Cribb and Foote, successfully set up branch shops in the area to aid farmers with supplies. There are glowing reports from some farmers who said they wouldn't have managed without their generosity, kindness and help.

    <p>A German Waggon</p>
    </div>
    
    Originally, farmers would travel to Ipswich with horse and wagon (known as the German Waggon), taking many days each way. The trip was difficult with crude roads and was made more difficult often having loads of produce which could spoil. With the rail, the time was sliced to a fraction and eventually with road transport and improved roads, the trips became matter of fact. 
    <br><br>
    
    As time went by, Ipswich grew into a city and continued to be the thriving hub for the Fassifern. It became a place to work, a place to shop, with many food and department stores, service industries and businesses, including dentists, doctors, hospitals, schools, churches, funeral services, administrative, legal and justice systems, police, public service, public houses, entertainment, household supplies, clothing, motor cars, farm machinery and everything else the heart could desire became available in the thriving metropolis.

    <h5>Ipswich Immigration Depot</h5>
    
    Early in 1864 an immigration depot was nearing completion in Ipswich on the northern side of the Bremer River to house all migrants upon arrival in Moreton Bay. To transport them along the Brisbane and Bremer rivers to the depot, the government had acquired a steamer by the name of "Kate" which was built in Newcastle-upon-Tyne in 1864. It departed London on 30 August 1864 and arrived almost seven months later under sails, the masts of which were later removed. 
    <br><br>

  
    Necessarily, those who settled in the Fassifern had to originally pass through an immigration depot, such as the one in Ipswich, or before it was finished, the one in South Brisbane. Reports about these depots are somewhat patchy and sketchy but always horrible. The conditions at times were often a cause for concern to the authorities who repeatedly announced that the situation needed looking into. 
    <br><br>
    Unfortunately, a lot of people who arrived a little earlier in Queensland passed through the depot in South Brisbane. So it was, for those on the La Rochelle who arrived 
    in 1864 around which time a writer for the Queensland Times said: <br>
    
    <div style="padding: 6px 30px 13px 20px;">
    <i>Among all the wretched and miserable sheds used as temporary dwellings within the city, most unquestionably the Immigration Depot in South Brisbane is the most wretched and miserable.</i> </div>
    
    The South Brisbane Immigration Depot, or at least that which it was called, was actually made up of three large disused sheds, not even suitable for cattle, situated alongside Towns' Wharf at the end of Russel Street where a ferry crossed the Brisbane River to Queen's Wharf on the northern side. The shed for the married couples and their children was one huge open area without any ventilation, completely without any facilities or furniture and held an unbearable stench, reaching temperatures close to 40 degrees centigrade. Even though the shed wouldn't have been sufficient for 20 people, 200 or so immigrants were packed into it and were generally in a state of mayhem.
    <br><br>
    
    Eventually, there was a new purpose-built multi-storey depot constructed in William Street on the other side of the river near the Queen's Wharf. In time, it too was replaced by a larger building at Kangaroo Point. This location, known as the Yungaba Immigration Depot, had its first migrant occupants take up residence at the end of 1887.
    <br><br>
    
    It's worth noting that on September 3, 1864, both the La Rochelle from Hamburg and the Young England from Liverpool arrived at Moreton Bay. The La Rochelle had about 180 German immigrants on board. The Young England was carrying "about 800 tons of general Merchandise, a large portion of which is composed of railway plant" (Brisbane Courier 5 Sep 1864). This "railway plant" coming from England was required to build the railway line from Ipswich to Grandchester.

    Even though Ipswich played a large and important role in the development of the district, it was Boonah which became the commercial focal point of the Fassifern. Situated 30 miles (45 km) due south of Ipswich, Boonah gained its name from the last railway siding before Dugandan at the end of the Fassifern line, which was finished in 1887. At that time, the settlement was known as Blumbergville, named after the shop and hotel owned and run by the Blumberg brothers. 
    <br><br>

    </div>
    
    
    

    That year (1887) also saw devastating floods in the area with the result that the commercial district of Dugandan moved to higher ground in the nearby Blumbergville. By 1888, the post office in Blumbergville was renamed to Boonah Post Office and the Goolman Division council moved its office from Flinders to its new location in Boonah. 
    

    Boonah remained the centre of the Shire of Boonah local government area until council amalgamations occurred in 2008 at which time it was merged into the Scenic Rim. From 1879 to 1890, it was the southern part of the Division of Goolman, the northern part being split off in 1890 to form the Division of Normanby. The name was officially changed to Shire of Boonah on 14 October 1937. In 1949, the Shire of Normanby was abolished and its southern part was merged with the Shire of Boonah. The area of the shire was almost 742 square miles whereas the Boonah district covered 552 square miles (over 143,000 hectares), the majority of which is used for pasture or cultivation.

    <b>George Thorn junior</b> was born in Sydney, New South Wales on 12 October 1838, and was not only three times the Member for Fassifern, he was also Queensland State Premier from 3 May 1860 to 3 April 1861. Although his father, George Thorn senior from Hampshire in England, was dubbed "Father of Ipswich", he initially rejected a grant of land in the Ipswich district by Governor Bourke on the grounds of it being primitive and worthless and would never become anything more than it was. Nevertheless he remained living in Ipswich, eventually becoming a member of the Queensland Legislative Assembly. So did four of his sons, George Thorn junior, John Thorn, Henry Thorn, William Thorn and sons-in-law George Harris and Richard Casey whose son, Baron Casey, served as the 16th Governor General from 7 May 1965 to 30 April 1969.

    In 1868, Murray-Prior's first wife died and in 1872 he married Banjo Patterson's auntie, Nora Clarina Barton. He died in 1892 and left behind seven of the twelve children of his first marriage and seven of the eight of his second. Throughout his life he claimed to have descended from Emperor Charlemagne.
    
    In 1863, Rachel Henning wrote of Murray-Prior:<br>
    <i>    
    'I suppose it does not require any great talent to be a Postmaster General. 
    I hope not, for such a goose I have seldom seen. He talked incessantly and 
    all his conversation consisted of pointless stories of which he himself was the hero.'
